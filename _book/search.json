    "text": "Elementary Arithmetic and Algebra\nIt’s useful in machine learning to be able to read and manipulate basic arithmetic and algebraic equations. I won’t go into depth on the basics of high school arithmetic and algebra. I do have to assume some mathematical maturity of the reader, and this seems like a good place to draw the line. I’ll just mention a few key points.\nRecall that numbers can come in several forms. We can have, - Positive whole numbers \\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\cdots\\] These are sometimes called the natural numbers or the positive integers. Note the inclusion of \\(0\\) in this group. Following the computer science convention I’ll tend to do that. - Whole numbers \\[\\cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots\\] These can be positive or negative. They’re called the integers. - Ratios of whole numbers, for example \\[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{4}, -\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{1000}{999}, \\cdots\\] Any ratio will do, so long as the denominator (the bottom number) is not zero. These are called the rational numbers. - Arbitrary decimal numbers, for example \\[1.00, \\ 5.07956, \\ -0.99999\\dots, \\ \\pi=3.1415\\dots, \\ e=2.718\\dots, \\ \\cdots\\] These are called the real numbers. They include as a special case both the integers and the rational numbers, but also include numbers that can’t be represented as fractions, like \\(\\pi\\) and \\(e\\). - Complex numbers like \\(1 + 2i\\) where \\(i=\\sqrt{-1}\\) is the imaginary number. Complex numbers include the real numbers as a special case. Since they don’t really show up in machine learning we won’t deal with these after this.\nYou should be familiar with the usual arithmetic operations defined on these systems of numbers. Things like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You should also at least vaguely recall the order of operations, which defines the order in which complex arithmetic operations with parenthesis are carried out. For example,\n\\[(5+1) \\cdot \\frac{(7-3)^2}{2} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{4^2}{2} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{16}{2} = 6 \\cdot 8 = 48.\\]\nYou should be able to manipulate and simplify simple fractions by hand. For example,\n\\[\\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot 7}{7 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{22}{35} \\approx 0.62857.\\]\nAs far as basic algebra goes, you should be familiar with algebraic expressions like \\(x+5=7\\) and be able to solve for the unknown variable \\(x\\),\n\\[x=7-5=2.\\]\nYou should be able to take an equation like \\(ax + b = c\\) and solve it for \\(x\\) in terms of coefficients \\(a, b, c\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nax + b &= c \\\\\nax &= c - b \\\\\nx &= \\frac{c - b}{a}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nYou should also be able to expand simple expressions like this,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(ax - b)^2 &= (ax - b)(ax - b) \\\\\n&= (ax)^2 - (ax)b - b(ax) + b^2 \\\\\n&= a^2x^2 - abx - abx + b^2 \\\\\n&= a^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThat’s pretty much it. Just simple variable manipulation.\nAs I’m sure you’ve seen before, a mathematical function is a way to map inputs \\(x\\) to outputs \\(y\\). That is, a function \\(f(x)\\) is a mapping that takes in a value \\(x\\) and maps it to a unique value \\(y=f(x)\\). These values can be either single numbers (called scalars), or multiple numbers (vectors or tensors). When \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both scalars, \\(f(x)\\) is called a univariate function.\nLet’s quickly cover some of the common functions you’d have seen before in a math class, focusing mainly on the ones that show up in machine learning. I’ll also cover a couple machine-learning specific functions you perhaps haven’t seen before.\nWhat we’ve covered thus far only deals with univariate functions, functions where \\(y=f(x)\\), but \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are just single numbers, i.e. scalars. In machine learning we’re almost always dealing with multivariate functions with lots of variables, sometimes billions of them. It turns out that most of what I’ve covered so far extends straight forwardly to multivariate functions with some small caveats, which I’ll cover below.\nSimply put, a multivariate function is a function of multiple variables. Instead of a single variable \\(x\\), we might have several variables, e.g. \\(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\),\n\\[y = f(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5).\\]\nIf you think about mathematical functions analogously to python functions it shouldn’t be surprising functions can have multiple arguments. They usually do, in fact.\nHere’s an example of a function that takes two arguments \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and produces a single output \\(z\\), more often written as \\(z=f(x,y)\\). The function we’ll look at is \\(z = x^2 + y^2\\). I’ll evaluate the function at three points: - \\(x=0\\), \\(y=0\\), - \\(x=1\\), \\(y=-1\\), - \\(x=0\\), \\(y=1\\).\nThe main thing to notice is the function does exactly what you think it does. If you plug in 2 values, you get out 1 value.\nWe can also have functions that map multiple inputs to multiple outputs. Suppose we have a function that takes in 2 values \\(x_0, x_1\\) and outputs 2 values \\(y_0, y_1\\). We’d write this as \\((y_0, y_1) = f(x_0, x_1)\\).\nConsider the following example,\n\\[(y_0, y_1) = f(x_0, x_1) = (x_0+x_1, x_0-x_1).\\]\nThis is really just two functions, both functions of \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_1\\). We can completely equivalently write this function as\n\\[y_0 = f_1(x_0, x_1) = x_0+x_1,\\] \\[y_1 = f_2(x_0, x_1) = x_0-x_1.\\]\nHere’s this function defined and evaluated at the point \\(x_0=1\\), \\(x_1=1\\).\nFor now I’ll just focus on the case of multiple inputs, single output like the first example. These are usually called scalar-valued functions. We can also have vector-valued functions, which are functions whose outputs can have multiple values as well. I’ll focus on scalar-valued functions here.\nA scalar-valued function of \\(n\\) variables \\(x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_{n-1}\\) has the form\n\\[y = f(x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_{n-1}).\\]\nNote \\(n\\) can be as large as we want it to be. When working with deep neural networks (which are just multivariate functions of a certain form) \\(n\\) can be huge. For example, if the input is a \\(256 \\times 256\\) image, the input might be \\(256^2=65536\\) pixels. For a 10 second audio clip that’s sampled at 44 kHz, the input might be \\(10*44k=440k\\) amplitudes. Large numbers indeed.\nCalculating the output of multivariate functions is just as straight-forward as for univariate functions pretty much. Unfortunately, visualizing them is much harder. The human eye can’t see 65536 dimensions, only 3 dimensions. This in some sense means we need to give up on the ability to “graph” a function and instead find other ways to visualize it.\nOne thing that sometimes help to visualize high dimension functions is to pretend they’re functions of two variables, like \\(z=f(x,y)\\). In this special case we can visualize the inputs as an xy-plane, and the output as a third axis sticking out perpendicular to the xy-plane from the origin. Each \\(x,y\\) pair will map to one unique \\(z\\) value. Done this way, we won’t get a graph of a curve as before, but a surface.\nHere’s an example of what this might look like for the simple function \\(z=x^2+y^2\\). I’ll plot the function on the domain \\(-10 \\leq x \\leq 10\\) and \\(-10 \\leq y \\leq 10\\) using the helper function plot_3d. It takes in two lists of values x and y. I’ll use np.linspace to sample 100 points from -10 to 10 for each. Then I’ll define a lambda function that maps x and y to the output z. Passing these three arguments into the helper function gives us our 3D plot.\nNotice how the plot looks like an upward facing bowl. Imagine a bowl lying on a table. The table is the xy-plane. The bowl is the surface \\(z=x^2+y^2\\) we’re plotting. While the plot shows the general idea what’s going on, 3D plots can often be difficult to look at. They’re often slanted at funny angles and hide important details.\nHere’s another way we can visualize the same function: Rather than create a third axis for \\(z\\), we can plot it directly on the xy-plane as a 2D plot. Since we’re dealing with a surface, not a curve, we have to do this for lots of different \\(z\\) values, which will give a family of curves. For example, we might plot all of the following curves corresponding to different values of \\(z\\) in the xy-plane,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n25 &= x^2 + y^2, \\\\\n50 &= x^2 + y^2, \\\\\n75 &= x^2 + y^2, \\\\\n100 &= x^2 + y^2, \\\\\n125 &= x^2 + y^2, \\\\\n150 &= x^2 + y^2.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDoing this will give a family of curves on one 2D plot, with each curve representing some value of \\(z\\). In our example, these curves are all circles of radius \\(z^2\\). Each curve is called a level curve or level set.\nThese kinds of plots are called contour plots. A contour map can be thought of as looking at the surface from the top down, where each level set corresponds to slicing the function \\(z=f(x,y)\\) horizontally for different values of \\(z\\). This trick is often used in topographical maps to visualize 3D terrain on a 2D sheet of paper. Here is a contour plot for \\(z=x^2+y^2\\) using the above level curves.\nNotice how we get a bunch of concentric rings in the contour plot, each labeled by some value (their \\(z\\) values). These rings correspond to the circles I was talking about. You can visually imagine this plot as looking down from the top of the bowl. In the middle you see the bottom. The rings get closer together the further out you go, which indicates that the bowl is sloping steeper the further out we get.\nWe’ll see more examples of multivariate functions in the coming lessons.\nIn machine learning we’ll find ourselves frequently interested not just with single equations, but multiple equations each with many variables. One thing we might seek to do is solve these coupled systems, which means finding a solution that satisfies every equation simultaneously. Consider the following example,\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   x & {}+{} &  y & {}={} & 2  \\\\\n   2x & {}-{} &  3y & {}={} & 7.\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\]\nThis system consists of two equations, \\(x + y = 2\\), and \\(2x - 3y = 7\\). Each equation contains two unknown variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We need to find a solution for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfies both of these equations.\nUsually the easiest and most general way to solve simple coupled systems like this is the method of substitution. The idea is to solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other, then plug that solution into the second equation to solve for the other variable. Once the second variable is solved for, we can go back and solve for the first variable explicitly. Let’s start by solving the first equation for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). This is pretty easy,\n\\[x = 2 - y.\\]\nNow we can take this solution for \\(x\\) and plug it into the second equation to solve for \\(y\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x - 3y &= 7 \\\\\n2(2 - y) - 3y &= 7 \\\\\n4 - 5y &= 7 \\\\\n5y &= -3 \\\\\ny &= -\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWith \\(y\\) in hand, we can now solve for \\(x\\), \\(x = 2 - y = 2 + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}\\). Thus, the pair \\(x=\\frac{13}{5}\\), \\(y=-\\frac{3}{5}\\) is the solution that solves both of these coupled equations simultaneously.\nHere’s sympy’s solution to the same system. It should of course agree with what I just got, which it does.\nNotice that both of the equations in this example are linear, since each term only contains terms proportional to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). There are no terms like \\(x^2\\) or \\(\\sin y\\) or whatever. Linear systems of equations are special because they can always be solved as long as there are enough variables. I’ll spend a lot more time on these when I get to linear algebra.\nWe can also imagine one or more equations being nonlinear. Provided we can solve each equation one-by-one, we can apply the method of substitution to solve these too. Here’s an example. Consider the nonlinear system\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{x + y} &= 10  \\\\\nxy &= 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nLet’s solve the second equation first since it’s easier. Solving for \\(y\\) gives \\(y = \\frac{1}{x}\\). Now plug this into the first equation and solve for \\(x\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{x + y} &= 10  \\\\\ne^{x + 1/x} &= 10  \\\\\n\\log \\big(e^{x + 1/x}\\big) &= \\log 10 \\\\\nx + \\frac{1}{x} &= \\log 10 \\\\\nx^2 - \\log 10 \\cdot x + 1 &= 0 \\\\\nx &= \\frac{1}{2} \\bigg(\\log 10 \\pm \\sqrt{(\\log 10)^2 - 4}\\bigg) \\\\\nx &\\approx 0.581, \\ 1.722.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nNote here I had to use the quadratic formula, which I’ll assume you’ve forgotten. If you have a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), then it will (usually) have exactly two solutions given by the formula\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{2a} \\bigg(-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\\bigg).\\]\nThis means we have two different possible solutions for \\(x\\), which thus means we’ll also have two possible solutions to \\(y\\) since \\(y=\\frac{1}{x}\\). Thus, this system has two possible solutions,\n\\[\\text{Solution 1: }x \\approx 0.581, \\ y \\approx 1.722,\\] \\[\\text{Solution 2: }x \\approx 1.722, \\ y \\approx 0.581.\\]\nIt’s interesting how symmetric these two solutions are. They’re basically the same with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) swapped. This is because the system has symmetry. You can swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the system above and not change the equation, which means the solutions must be the same up to permutation of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)!\nHere’s sympy’s attempt to solve this system.\nIn general, it’s not even possible to solve a system of nonlinear equations except using numerical methods. The example I gave was rigged so I could solve it by hand. General purpose root-finding algorithms exist that can solve arbitrary systems of equations like this numerically, no matter how nonlinear they are.\nTo solve a nonlinear system like this numerically, you can use the scipy function scipy.optimize.fsolve. Scipy is an extension of numpy that includes a lot of algorithms for working with non-linear functions. To use fsolve, you have to define the system as a function mapping a list of variables to a list of equations. You also have to specify a starting point x0 for the root finder. This tells it where to start looking for the root. Since nonlinear equations have multiple solutions, picking a different x0 can and will often give you a different root. I won’t dwell on all this since we don’t really need to deal with root finding much in machine learning.\nLike many other technical fields, machine learning makes heavy use of the Greek alphabet to represent variable names in mathematical equations. While not all Greek characters are used, certain ones are worth being aware of. Below is a table of the Greek letters upper and lower case, as well as a guide on how to pronounce and write them. You don’t need to memorize all of these letters, but they will frequently show up in future lessons, so you may want to reference this table often until you’re comfortable with Greek letters."

    "text": "Symbolic Computation\nThere are two fundamental ways to perform mathematical computations: numerical computation, and symbolic computation. You’re familiar with both even though you may not realize it. Numerical computation involves crunching numbers. You plug in numbers, and get out numbers. When you type something like 10.5 / 12.4 in python, it will return a number, like 0.8467741935483871. This is numerical computation.\n\n10.5 / 12.4\n\n0.8467741935483871\n\n\nThis contrasts with a way of doing computations that you learned in math class, where you manipulate symbols. This is called symbolic computation. Expanding an equation like \\((ax-b)^2\\) to get \\(a^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2\\) is an example of a symbolic computation. You see the presence of abstract variables like \\(x\\) that don’t have a set numeric value.\nUsually in practice we’re interested in numerical computations. We’ll mostly be doing that in this book. But sometimes, when working with equations, we’ll need to do symbolic computations as well. Fortunately, python has a library called SymPy, or sympy, that can do symbolic computation automatically. I won’t use it a whole lot in this book, but it will be convenient in a few places to show you that you don’t need to manipulate mathematical expressions by hand all the time.\nTo use sympy, I’ll import sympy with the alias sp. Before defining a function to operate on, we first have to encode all the symbols in the problem as sympy Symbol objects. Once that’s done, we can create equations out of them and perform mathematical operations.\nHere’s an example of using sympy to expand the equation above, \\((ax-b)^2\\).\n\nimport sympy as sp\n\n\na = sp.Symbol('a')\nb = sp.Symbol('b')\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\na, b, x\n\n(a, b, x)\n\n\n\nequation = (a * x - b) ** 2\nsp.expand(equation, x)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle a^{2} x^{2} - 2 a b x + b^{2}\\)\n\n\nWe can also use sympy to solve equations.

Since we won’t really need it all that often I’ll skip the in depth tutorial. See the documentation if you’re interested."

    "section": "Affine Functions",
    "text": "Affine Functions\nThe most basic functions to be aware of are the straight-line functions: constant functions, linear functions, and affine functions: - Constant functions \\(y=c\\) or \\(x=c\\): For example, \\(y=2\\), \\(x=1\\). - Linear functions \\(y=ax\\): For example, \\(y=-x\\), \\(y=5x\\). - Affine functions \\(y=ax+b\\): For example, \\(y=-x+1\\), \\(y=5x-4\\).\nAll constant functions are affine functions, and all linear functions are affine functions. In the case of affine functions, the value \\(b\\) is called the intercept. It corresponds to the value where the function crosses the y-axis. The value \\(a\\) is called the slope. It corresponds to the steepness of the curve, i.e. its height over its width (or “rise” over “run”). Notice linear functions are the special case where the intercept is always the origin \\(x=0, y=0\\).\n\nPlotting\nWe can plot these and any other univariate function \\(y=f(x)\\) in the usual way you learned about in school. We sample a lot of \\((x,y)\\) pairs from the function, and plot them on a grid with a horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis.\nBefore plotting some examples I need to mention that plotting in python is usually done with the matplotlib library. Typically what we’d do to get a very simple plot is: 1. Import plt, which is the alias to the submodule matplotlib.pyplot 2. Get a grid of x values we want to plot, e.g. using np.linspace or np.arange 3. Get a grid of y values either directly, or by first defining a python function f(x) 4. Plot x vs y by calling plt.(x, y), followed by plt.show().\nNote step (2) requires another library called numpy to create the grid of points. You don’t have to use numpy for this, but it’s typically easiest. Usually numpy is imported with the alias np. Numpy is python’s main library for working with numerical arrays. We’ll cover it in much more detail in future lessons.\nLet me go ahead and load these libraries. I’ll also show a simple example of a plot. What I’ll do is define a grid x of 100 equally spaced points between -10 and 10, and plot the function \\(y=x-1\\) using the method described above.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nx = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)\ny = x - 1\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately this plot is pretty ugly. It’s too big, arbitrarily scaled, and doesn’t include any information about what’s being plotted against what. In matplotlib if you want to include all these things to make nice plots you have to include a bunch of extra style commands.\nFor this reason, for the rest of the plotting in this lesson I’m going to use a helper function plot_function, which takes in x and y, the range of x values we want to plot, and an optional title. I didn’t think the details of this helper function were worth going into now, so I abstracted it away into the file utils.py in this same directory. It uses matplotlib like I described, but with a good bit of styling to make the plot more readable. If you really want to see the details perhaps the easiest thing to do is create a cell below using ESC-B and type the command ??plot_function, which will print the code inside the function as the output.\nBack to it, let’s plot one example each of a constant function \\(y=2\\), a linear function \\(y=2x\\), and an affine function \\(2x-1\\).\n\nx = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)\nf = lambda x: 2 * np.ones(len(x))\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(-5, 5), ticks_every=[1, 1], title='Constant Function: $y=2$')\n\n\n\n\n\nx = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)\nf = lambda x: 2 * x\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(-5, 5), ticks_every=[1, 1], title='Linear Function: $y=2x$')\n\n\n\n\n\nx = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)\nf = lambda x: 2 * x - 1\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(-5, 5), ticks_every=[1, 1], title='Affine Function: $y=2x-1$')\n\n\n\n\nNote the following observations from each plot. 1. The constant function is horizontal. 2. The linear function is just a rightward-sloping line that passes through the origin \\((0,0)\\) and the point \\((1,2)\\). 3. The affine function is just the same linear function shifted down by one unit of \\(y\\)."

    "text": "Exponentials and Logarithms\nTwo very important functions are the exponential function \\(y=\\exp(x)\\) and the logarithm function \\(y=\\log(x)\\). They show up surprisingly often in machine learning and the sciences, certainly more than most other special functions do.\nThe exponential function can be written as a power by defining a number \\(e\\) called Euler’s number, given by \\(e = 2.71828\\dots\\) . Like \\(\\pi\\), \\(e\\) is an example of an irrational number, i.e. a number that can’t be represented as a ratio of integers. Using \\(e\\), we can write the exponential function in the more usual form \\(y=e^x\\), where it’s roughly speaking understood that we mean “multiply \\(e\\) by itself \\(x\\) times”. For example, \\(\\exp(2) = e^2 = e \\cdot e\\).\nThe logarithm is defined as the inverse of the exponential function. It’s the unique function satisfying \\(\\log(\\exp(x)) = x\\). The opposite is also true since the exponential must then be the inverse of the logarithm function, \\(\\exp(\\log(x)) = x\\). This gives a way of mapping between the two functions,\n\\[\\log(a) = b \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\exp(b) = a.\\]\nHere are some plots of what the exponential and logarithm functions look like. The exponential function is a function that blows up very, very quickly. The log function grows very, very slowly (much more slowly than the square root does).\nNote the log function is only defined for positive-valued numbers \\(x \\geq 0\\), with \\(\\log(+0)=-\\infty\\). This is dual to the exponential function only taking on \\(y \\geq 0\\).\n\nx = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.1)\nf = lambda x: np.exp(x)\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(-1, 10), ticks_every=[1, 2], title='Exponential Function: $y=\\exp(x)$')\n\n\n\n\n\nx = np.arange(0.01, 5, 0.1)\nf = lambda x: np.log(x)\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-1, 5), ylim=(-5, 2), ticks_every=[1, 1], title='Logarithm Function: $y=\\log(x)$')\n\n\n\n\nThe exponential and logarithm functions I defined are the “natural” way to define these functions. We can also have exponential functions in other bases, \\(y=a^x\\) for any positive number \\(a\\). Each \\(a\\) has an equivalent logarithm, written \\(y = \\log_{a}(x)\\). The two functions \\(y=a^x\\) and \\(y=\\log_{a}(x)\\) are inverses of each other. When I leave off the \\(a\\), it’s assumed that all logs are the natural base \\(a=e\\), sometimes also written \\(\\ln(x)\\).\nTwo common examples of other bases that show up sometimes are the base-2 functions \\(2^x\\) and \\(\\log_{2}(x)\\), and the base-10 functions \\(10^x\\) and \\(\\log_{10}(x)\\). Base-2 functions in particular show up often in computer science because of the tendency to think in bits. Base-10 functions show up when we want to think about how many digits a number has.\nHere are some rules that exponentials and logs obey:\n\n\n\n\nRule\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\\(e^0 = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\log(1) = 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\log(e) = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(e^{a+b} = e^a e^b\\)\n\n\n\\(e^{2+5} = e^2 e^5 = e^8 \\approx 2980.96\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(e^{a-b} = \\frac{e^a}{e^b}\\)\n\n\n\\(e^{2-5} = \\frac{e^2}{e^5} = e^{-3} \\approx 0.0498\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(e^{ab} = (e^a)^b\\)\n\n\n\\(e^{2 \\cdot 5} = (e^2)^5 = e^{10} \\approx 22026.47\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^b = e^{b \\log(a)}\\)\n\n\n\\(2^3 = e^{3 \\log(2)} = 8\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)\\)\n\n\n\\(\\log(2 \\cdot 5) = \\log(2) + \\log(5) = \\log(10) \\approx 2.303\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\log\\big(\\frac{a}{b}\\big) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)\\)\n\n\n\\(\\log\\big(\\frac{2}{5}\\big) = \\log(2) - \\log(5) \\approx -0.916\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\log(a^b) = b\\log(a)\\)\n\n\n\\(\\log(5^2) = 2\\log(5) \\approx 3.219\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\log_a(x) = \\frac{\\log(x)}{\\log(a)}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\log_2(5) = \\frac{\\log(5)}{\\log(2)} \\approx 2.322\\)\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an example of an equation involving exponentials and logs. Suppose you have \\(n\\) bits of numbers (perhaps it’s the precision in some float) and you want to know how many digits this number takes up in decimal form (what you’re used to). This would be equivalent to solving the following equation for \\(x\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n2^n &= 10^{x} \\\\\n\\log(2^n) &= \\log(10^{x}) \\\\\nn\\log(2) &= x\\log(10) \\\\\nx &= \\frac{\\log(2)}{\\log(10)} \\cdot n \\\\\nx &\\approx 0.3 \\cdot n.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor example, you can use this formula to show that 52 bits of floating point precision translates to about 15 to 16 digits of precision. In numpy, the function np.log function calculates the (base-\\(e\\)) log of a number.\n\nn = 52\nx = np.log(2) / np.log(10) * n\nx\n\n15.65355977452702"

Continuous functions we can often write using a single equation, like \\(y=x^2\\) or \\(y=1 + \\sin(x)\\). We can also have functions that require more than one equation to write. These are called piecewise functions. Piecewise functions usually aren’t continuous, but sometimes can be.\nAn example of a discontinuous piecewise function is the unit step function \\(y=u(x)\\) given by\n\\[\ny =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x < 0, \\\\\n1 & x \\geq 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis expression means \\(y=0\\) whenever \\(x < 0\\), but \\(y=1\\) whenever \\(x \\geq 0\\). It breaks up into two pieces, one horizontal line \\(y=0\\) when \\(x\\) is negative, and another horizontal line \\(y=1\\) when \\(x\\) is positive.\nUsing Boolean expressions, we can also write this function in a more economical way by agreeing to identify \\(x=1\\) with \\(\\text{TRUE}\\) and \\(x=0\\) with \\(\\text{FALSE}\\), which python does by default. In this notation, we can write\n\\[u(x) = [x \\geq 0],\\]\nwhich means exactly the same thing as the piecewise definition, since \\(x \\geq 0\\) is only true when (you guessed it), \\(x \\geq 0\\).\nHere’s a plot of this function.

Both lines connect at \\(x=0\\), but leave a kink in the graph.\nAnother way to write the same thing using Boolean expressions is \\(y = x \\cdot [x \\geq 0]\\), which is of course just \\(y = x \\cdot u(x)\\).\nIn machine learning it’s more common to write the ramp function using the \\(\\max\\) function as \\(y = \\max(0,x)\\). This means, for each \\(x\\), take that value and compare it with \\(0\\), and take the maximum of those two. That is, if \\(x\\) is negative take \\(y=0\\), otherwise take \\(y=x\\). It’s also more common to call this function a rectified linear unit, or ReLU for short. It’s an ugly, unintuitive name, but unfortunately it’s stuck in the field.\nHere’s a plot of the ramp or ReLU function. Notice how it stays at \\(y=0\\) for a while, then suddenly “ramps upward” at \\(x=0\\).\n\nx = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)\nf = lambda x:  x * (x >= 0)\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-3, 3), ylim=(-3, 3), ticks_every=[1, 1], title='ReLU Function')\n\n\n\n\nLast, I’ll mention here the absolute value function \\(y = |x|\\), defined by the piecewise function\n\\[\ny = \\begin{cases}\nx & \\text{if } x \\ge 0 \\\\\n-x & \\text{if } x < 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe absolute value just ignores negative signs and makes everything positive. The function looks like the usual line \\(y=x\\) when positive, but like the negative-sloped line \\(y=-x\\) when negative. At \\(x=0\\) the two lines meet, creating a distinctive v-shape. To get the absolute value function in python, use abs or np.abs.\n\nx = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.1)\nf = lambda x: abs(x)\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(0, 5), ticks_every=[1, 1], title='Absolute Value Function: $y=|x|$')"

    "text": "Infinitesimals\nFundamental to the understanding of calculus is the idea of an “infinitely small” number, called an infinitesimal. An infinitesimal is a number that’s not 0 but so close to being 0 that you can’t really tell it isn’t 0. These small numbers are often written in math with letters like \\(\\varepsilon\\) or \\(\\delta\\). Think of them as very very tiny numbers, so tiny their square is basically 0: \\[\\varepsilon > 0, \\quad \\varepsilon^2 \\approx 0.\\]\nBut what does this even mean? Here it might be helpful to recall our discussion of floating point numbers. Recall that we can’t get infinite precision. In python’s double precision floating point we can only get down to about \\(5 \\cdot 10^{-324}\\), or 5e-324. If the square of a small number has a value smaller than about 5e-324 we’d literally get 0.0 as far as python is concerned.\nJust for fun let’s look at the really tiny number \\(10^{-300}\\), or 1e-300. That’s 300 decimal places of zeros before the 1 even shows up. Python thinks 1e-300 is just fine. But what happens if we square it? We should in theory get \\(10^{-600}\\), or 600 decimal places of zeros followed by a 1. But as far as floating point is concerned, the square is zero.\nOf course, you could argue that we could just go to a higher precision then. Use more bits. But eventually, if we keep making \\(\\varepsilon\\) small enough we’ll hit a point where \\(\\varepsilon^2 = 0\\). Thus, if it makes you feel better, when you see an infinitesimal just think “\\(10^{-300}\\) in double precision”.\nAside: If you want to be really pedantic, you might say that it shouldn’t matter what a computer does, since any positive number \\(\\varepsilon\\) squared must still be greater than zero, no matter how small \\(\\varepsilon\\) is. This is true for real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). But it turns out infinitesimals aren’t real numbers at all. They lie in an extension of the real number line called the hyperreal numbers, denoted \\(\\mathbb{R}^*\\). In my opinion, this isn’t an important distinction to worry about in applied calculus.\nSimilar to infinitesimals being numbers that can be really, really small, we can also talk about numbers being really, really big. These are called infinitely large numbers. In analogy to infinitesimals, infinitely large numbers are positive numbers \\(N\\) whose square is basically infinite,\n\\[N > 0, \\quad N^2 \\approx \\infty.\\]\nWe can get infinitely large numbers by inverting infinitesimals, and vice versa,\n\\[N = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}, \\quad \\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{N}.\\]\nIf \\(10^{-300}\\) is a good rule of thumb for an infinitesimal, then \\(10^{300}\\) is a good rule of thumb for an infinitely large number.\nInfinitesimals are especially interesting when added to regular numbers. These are called first order perturbations. For example, consider some finite number \\(x\\). It could be \\(2\\) or \\(-100\\) or whatever you want. Suppose now we add to it an infinitesimal number \\(\\varepsilon\\). Now suppose we have an output \\(y\\) that depends on \\(x\\) through a function \\(y=f(x)=x^2\\). What happens to \\(y\\) if we perturb \\(x\\) to \\(x+\\varepsilon\\)? That is, what is \\(f(x + \\varepsilon)=(x+\\varepsilon)^2\\)? Expanding the square, we have\n\\[f(x + \\varepsilon) = (x + \\varepsilon)^2 = x^2 + 2x\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon^2.\\]\nBut since \\(\\varepsilon^2 \\approx 0\\),\n\\[f(x + \\varepsilon) = (x + \\varepsilon)^2 \\approx x^2 + 2x\\varepsilon.\\]\nOkay, but what does this mean? Well, I can reformulate the question as follows: “If I change \\(x\\) by a little bit, how much does the function \\(y\\) change”? Call this change \\(\\delta\\), the change in \\(y\\) due to \\(x\\) getting changed by \\(\\varepsilon\\). Since \\(\\delta = f(x+\\varepsilon) - f(x)\\) by definition, we’d have\n\\[\\delta = f(x+\\varepsilon) - f(x) = (x+\\varepsilon)^2 - x^2 \\approx 2x\\varepsilon.\\]\nThat is, if we change \\(x\\) by a small amount \\(\\varepsilon\\), then \\(y\\) itself changes by a small amount \\(\\delta=2x\\varepsilon\\). Interestingly, how much \\(y\\) changes actually depends on which \\(x\\) we pick. If \\(x=1\\) then \\(y\\) changes by \\(2\\varepsilon\\), just twice how much \\(x\\) is nudged. If \\(x=1000\\) though, then \\(y\\) changes by \\(2000\\varepsilon\\), a much bigger change, but still infinitesimal. After all, \\(2000 \\cdot 10^{-300} = 2 \\cdot 10^{-297}\\) is still really, really small.\nSince integration is literally half of the subject of calculus, I owe it to at least briefly mention the topic. This section is only really applicable to the other topics in this book if you want to better understand probability distributions, something I’ll cover in detail in the next lesson. If you don’t mind thinking of probability distributions as histograms with infinitely many samples, you’re free to skip this section and move ahead."

    "text": "Limits\nOne application of infinitesimals is to look at the nearby behavior of a function around some point. Suppose we have some function \\(y=f(x)\\). We’d like to look at the nearby behavior of the function around some point \\(x=x_0\\). By that, I don’t mean, what is \\(f(x_0)\\), I mean what is \\(f(x)\\) when \\(x\\) is infinitesimally close to \\(x_0\\).\nConsider a first order perturbation \\(x = x_0+\\varepsilon\\) sending \\(f(x_0)\\) to \\(f(x_0+\\varepsilon)\\). Imagine making \\(\\varepsilon\\) smaller and smaller until it’s infinitesimal. If \\(y=f(x_0+\\varepsilon)\\) gets closer and closer to some value \\(L\\), we call \\(L\\) the limit as \\(x\\) approaches \\(x_0\\), and write\n\\[L = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0} f(x).\\]\nMore formally, say \\(L\\) is the limit if the difference \\(|f(x_0+\\varepsilon)-L|\\) is infinitesimal whenever \\(\\varepsilon\\) is too. Another notation for the limit is\n\\[y \\rightarrow L \\text{ as } x \\rightarrow x_0.\\]\nThis all seems kind of pedantic if you think about it. It seems like we’re doing a bunch of extra work just to evaluate the function at \\(x_0\\) to finally get \\(L=f(x_0)\\)? In most cases in practice this is true, but not always.\nA classic example is a function with a hole in it. Suppose we have a function \\(y=f(x)\\) like this\n\\[\ny =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & x = 0, \\\\\nx^2 & x \\neq 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nHere’s what it looks like. It’s just a parabola \\(y=x^2\\), but with a hole at \\(x=0\\) since \\(f(0)=1\\neq 0^2\\).\n\nx = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.01)\nf_neq_0 = lambda x: x ** 2\n\nplt.plot(x, f_neq_0(x), color='red', zorder=0)\nplt.scatter(0, 1, color='red', marker='o', s=20, zorder=1)\nplt.scatter(0, 0, c='white', edgecolors='red', marker='o', s=20, zorder=2)\nplt.grid(True, alpha=0.5)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('$y = 1$ if $x = 0$ else $x^2$')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we make a first order perturbation to this function about \\(x_0=0\\) by a small positive number \\(\\varepsilon > 0\\). Then\n\\[f(x_0+\\varepsilon) = f(0 + \\varepsilon) = f(\\varepsilon) = \\varepsilon^2.\\]\nIf we now allow \\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\), then clearly \\(\\varepsilon^2 \\rightarrow 0\\), so\n\\[L = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0 \\neq f(0) = 1.\\]\nThis is just a long drawn-out way of saying that the limit is what the function would be if it didn’t have a hole in it at \\(x_0=0\\). If the above function didn’t have a hole in it, then \\(f(0)\\) would be \\(L=0\\).\nA function that is well-behaved in this sense that it has no holes or jumps is called continuous. Continuous functions satisfy the very nice property that the limit can be pulled inside the function,\n\\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0} f(x) = f\\bigg(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow x_0} x\\bigg) = f(x_0).\\]\nSince almost every function we work with in practice is continuous, we can by and large take for granted that we can do this, keeping in mind that exceptions do occur and you sometimes have to be careful.\nIn my experience, the only real place limits seem to come up in machine learning is the infinite limit case when \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\),\n\\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} f(x).\\]\nThe easiest way to figure these limits out is to plug in a large value for \\(x\\) and see what \\(f(x)\\) is tending towards. For example, here’s a demonstration that\n\\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-x} = 0.\\]\nYou can see that \\(e^{-x}\\) is pretty much \\(0\\) by the time \\(x=20\\), which suggests the limit is \\(0\\) as \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\). While this isn’t a “proof”, it should be pretty convincing.\n\nfor x in np.exp(range(6)):\n    y = np.exp(-x)\n    print(f'x = {x.round(2)} \\t y = {y.round(8)}')\n\nx = 1.0      y = 0.36787944\nx = 2.72     y = 0.06598804\nx = 7.39     y = 0.00061798\nx = 20.09    y = 0.0\nx = 54.6     y = 0.0\nx = 148.41   y = 0.0\n\n\nIf you like, you can also use sympy to evaluate the infinite limit symbolically.\n\nx = sp.symbols('x')\ny = sp.exp(-x)\nsp.limit(y, x, sp.oo)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle 0\\)\n\n\nGenerally speaking, each additive term in a function will go like its most dominating component as \\(x \\rightarrow \\infty\\). For example, take the continuous function \\(y=x e^{-x} + 1\\). The first term \\(xe^{-x}\\) is dominated by \\(e^{-x}\\) when \\(x\\) is large, since it shrinks to \\(0\\) much faster than \\(x\\) increases. Since the other term just stays at \\(1\\), we get\n\\[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} (x e^{-x} + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1.\\]\nWhen \\(x\\) gets large, the following rule of thumb holds for different classes of functions, with functions to the left dominating functions to the right,\n\\[\\text{factorials} >> \\text{exponents} >> \\text{polynomials} >> \\text{logarithms} >> \\text{constants}.\\]\nIf you’ll recall, this exact same chain was shown when I talked about asymptotic notation. In fact, we can use infinite limits to formally define what big-oh notation means. Say a function \\(f(x)\\) is \\(O(g(x))\\) if\n\\[\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\bigg|\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}\\bigg| \\leq M\\]\nfor some finite constant \\(M > 0\\). For example, the function \\(f(n) = n^3 + 2n^2 - 5n\\) is \\(O(n^3)\\) since\n\\[\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\bigg|\\frac{n^3 + 2n^2 - 5n}{n^3}\\bigg| =  \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\bigg(1 + \\frac{2}{n} - \\frac{5}{n^2}\\bigg) = 1 \\leq 1.\\]"

    "section": "Derivatives",
    "text": "Derivatives\nLet’s go back to our example before where we looked at first order perturbations to the function \\(y=x^2\\). We showed if \\(x\\) is infinitesimally changed to \\(x + \\varepsilon\\), then \\(y\\) is changed to \\(y + \\delta \\approx 2x\\varepsilon\\).\nWhen we talk about changing \\(x\\) by a little bit and asking how \\(y\\) changes we use a cleaner notation. Instead of writing \\(x + \\varepsilon\\), we’d write \\(x + dx\\). Instead of writing \\(y + \\delta\\), we’d write \\(y + dy\\). These values \\(dx\\) and \\(dy\\) are called differentials.\nThey’re just infinitesimals like I defined them before, but this differential notation makes it clear what is a small change of what. Writing \\(dx\\) means “a little bit of \\(x\\)”. Writing \\(dy\\) means “a little bit of \\(y\\)”. This is where the term “differentiation” comes from.\nIn the language of differentials, we want to ask what happens to \\(y+dy\\) in response to perturbations \\(x+dx\\). In our running example, this is\n\\[y + dy = f(x+dx) = (x + dx)^2 = x^2 + 2xdx + dx^2 \\approx x^2 + 2xdx,\\]\nwith the approximate equality becoming exact when \\(dx\\) is infinitesimal.\nLet’s solve for \\(dy\\), how much \\(y\\) changes in response to \\(x\\) changing a little bit. Subtracting both sides by \\(y=x^2\\) just gives \\(dy = 2xdx\\). If we then divide both sides by \\(dx\\) we get \\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x.\\]\nThis ratio of differentials \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) is called the derivative of the function \\(y=x^2\\), usually just pronounced “dydx”. The act of taking a derivative is called differentiation. Notice there’s no infinitesimal (\\(dy\\) or \\(dx\\)) on the right-hand side, hence the derivative is not itself an infinitesimal. It’s finite.\nNotice that the derivative is a function since it maps inputs \\(x\\) to outputs \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=2x\\). To indicate this functional relationship people sometimes write either\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) \\quad \\text{ or } \\quad \\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)\\] to make this clear.\nLet’s use python to try to calculate what the derivative of \\(y=x^2\\) is for a specific value of \\(x\\), say \\(x=1\\). We can do this by taking smaller and smaller values of \\(dx\\) and looking at the ratio \\[\\frac{dy}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=1} = \\frac{(x+dx)^2 - x^2}{dx}\\] for different choices of \\(dx\\).\nNotation: Read the left-hand side of this expression as “the derivative evaluated at \\(x=1\\)”. Another way to write the same thing is \\(f'(1)\\) or \\(\\frac{d}{dx}f(1)\\).\nI’ll define a loop over some values of \\(dx\\) and see what the predicted derivative is. Since the exact derivative function is \\(2x\\), the exact answer at \\(x=1\\) should be \\[\\frac{dy}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=1} = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2.\\]\nI’ll also print out the error, which is the predicted value \\(2\\) minus the calculated value. Smaller error is better, obviously.\n\nf = lambda x: x ** 2\nx0 = 1\ndydx_exact = 2 * x0\nfor dx in [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-10, 1e-100, 1e-200]:\n    dydx = (f(x0 + dx) - f(x0)) / dx\n    error = dydx - dydx_exact\n    print(f'dx = {dx:8.16f} \\t dy/dx = {dydx:4f} \\t error = {error:4f}')\n\ndx = 1.0000000000000000      dy/dx = 3.000000    error = 1.000000\ndx = 0.1000000000000000      dy/dx = 2.100000    error = 0.100000\ndx = 0.0100000000000000      dy/dx = 2.010000    error = 0.010000\ndx = 0.0010000000000000      dy/dx = 2.001000    error = 0.001000\ndx = 0.0001000000000000      dy/dx = 2.000100    error = 0.000100\ndx = 0.0000100000000000      dy/dx = 2.000010    error = 0.000010\ndx = 0.0000000001000000      dy/dx = 2.000000    error = 0.000000\ndx = 0.0000000000000000      dy/dx = 0.000000    error = -2.000000\ndx = 0.0000000000000000      dy/dx = 0.000000    error = -2.000000\n\n\nStarting with \\(dx=1\\) is a bad choice, with a huge error of \\(1.0\\). We’re way off. Shrinking to \\(dx=0.1\\) puts us in the ball park with a value \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=2.1\\). You can see that making \\(dx\\) successively smaller and smaller makes the error successively smaller, in this case by a factor of 10 each time.\nThe error is getting smaller all the way down to about \\(dx=10^{-10}\\) before creeping up again as we make \\(dx\\) even smaller than that. This is due to the numerical roundoff of floating point numbers. We’re subtracting two numbers \\(f(x_0+dx) - f(x_0) = (1+dx)^2 - 1\\) that are very close to each other when \\(dx\\) is really small, which as you’ll recall is one of the pitfalls to avoid when working with floating point numbers.\nThis method we just used to calculate the derivative is essentially exactly how derivatives are usually calculated on a computer. The process of calculating the derivative this way, directly from its definition essentially, is called numerical differentiation. We choose a small value of \\(dx\\) and just apply the formula above, with some minor tweaks to get better accuracy in fewer steps. It’s common in practice to choose “less small” values for \\(dx\\) when calculating derivatives numerically like this, e.g. 1e-5.\nWe can talk about any reasonably well-behaved function \\(f(x)\\) having a derivative. If \\(y=f(x)\\) and we make a first order perturbation \\(x+dx\\), then \\(y\\) gets perturbed by \\(y+dy=f(x+dx)\\). The amount \\(y=f(x)\\) changes per amount \\(dx\\) is then the derivative\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{f(x+dx)-f(x)}{dx}.\\]\nThis definition is only exact when \\(dx\\) is infinitesimal. For finite values of \\(dx\\) (like what we’d code up on a computer) this equality is only approximately true.\nWhat do I mean when I say the function \\(f(x)\\) needs to be reasonably well behaved? For one thing, the function needs to be continuous. Informally, you can think of a univariate function as being continuous if you can draw its graph on a piece of paper without lifting your pen. There are no jumps or holes anywhere in the functions’ curve. More formally, a function is continuous at \\(x_0\\) if \\(f(x) \\rightarrow f(x_0)\\) as \\(x \\rightarrow x_0\\). That is, all the limits are what they should be. There are no holes or jumps in the graph.\nContinuity is just one condition necessary for \\(f(x)\\) to be differentiable. It also can’t be too jagged in some sense. Derivatives don’t make sense at points where there are kinks in the function curve. At points where there are kinks we have to use a slightly different kind of derivative called a subderivative.\nSince derivatives are functions we can take the derivative of the derivative too, \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{dy}{dx}\\), which turns out to be\n\\[\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{f(x+dx)-f(x)}{dx} = \\frac{f(x+2dx) - 2f(x+dx) + f(x)}{dx^2}.\\]\nThis is called a second derivative, and sometimes also written \\(f'(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x)\\).\nAs a quick example, the second derivative of our running function \\(y=x^2\\) is the first derivative of \\(2x\\), which is\n\\[\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = \\frac{2(x + dx) - 2x}{dx} = 2.\\]\nHigher-order derivatives can be defined as well by continuing to take derivatives of the second derivative, like third derivatives of fourth derivatives. These show up less prominently though, and as such aren’t discussed all that much."

    "text": "Visualizing Derivatives\nThe first derivative \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) has an interesting and useful geometric interpretation as the slope of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) at the point \\(x\\). To see this, imagine a right triangle with length \\(dx\\) and height \\(dy\\). The slope, or “steepness”, of its hypotenuse is just the ratio height over width, i.e. \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\).\n\nplot_right_triangle()\n\n\n\n\nWe can use this idea to talk about the slope of a function at a point. If \\(y=f(x)\\) is a function, then the derivative \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) at some point \\(x=x_0\\) is the slope of that function at the point \\((x_0,y_0)\\). It’s the slope of the line that hugs the point \\((x_0,y_0)\\) tangent to the curve. This “hugging line” is called the tangent line. We can pretty easily solve for what this line has to be. It must run through \\((x_0,y_0)\\) and have slope \\(m=\\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0)\\), so writing \\(y=mx+b\\) and solving for the intercept \\(b\\) would give the first order perturbation\n\\[y = y_0 + \\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0)(x - x_0).\\]\nHere’s an example. I’ll plot the function \\(y=x^2\\) and its tangent at a point \\(x_0=2\\) on the x-axis. The corresponding \\(y\\) at \\(x=2\\) is just \\(y_0=x_0^2=4\\). As we derived above, its derivative (and hence slope) at \\(x_0=2\\) is\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}f(2)=2(2)=4,\\]\nso the equation for the tangent line of \\(y=x^2\\) at \\(x_0=2\\) is\n\\[y = 4 + 4(x - 2) = 4x -4.\\]\nThe code below implements this calculation. I’ll define the function f that gives y = f(x) along with the derivative dydx = dfdx(x), and then use these two define a function f_line to calculate the tangent line, which also depends on a specified point x0.\nFeel free to adjust the value of x0 observe how the slope changes with the value you pick. In all cases, the line should hug the curve of the function and stay tangent to it.\n\nf = lambda x: x ** 2\ndfdx = lambda x: 2 * x\n\nx0 = 2\nx = np.arange(-3 * x0, 3 * x0, 0.1)\nf_line = lambda x: f(x0) + dfdx(x0) * (x - x0)\n\nplot_tangent_curve(x, x0, f, f_line, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(0, 10), \n                   title=f'Tangent Line of $y=x^2$ at ${(x0, f(x0))}$')\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, if the derivative \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) at a point is positive the tangent line will slant towards the right. If the derivative at that point is negative the tangent line will slant towards the left. If it’s zero, the tangent line there will be horizontal.\nThe second derivative \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\) has a geometric interpretation as well. It captures information about the curvature of the function. To see why this is true we need to look at second order perturbations. That is, we need to add in a term to the tangent line equation of order \\((x-x_0)^2\\),\n\\[y = f(x_0) + \\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0) (x-x_0) + \\color{red}{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x_0) (x-x_0)^2}.\\]\nWhat may seem weird is the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) out front of the red second-order term. This has to do with how Taylor series work, a topic I don’t see a need to cover at the moment. What’s important though is the term is quadratic, and it depends on the second derivative at \\(x=x_0\\).\nA second order perturbation defines a tangent parabola given by a quadratic function \\(y=ax^2+bx+c\\), where \\(a,b,c\\) are coefficients determined by the values of the inputs \\(f(x_0), \\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0), \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x_0)\\). Most importantly, the leading coefficient \\(a\\) is just the second derivative at \\(x=x_0\\), i.e. \\(a = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x_0)\\).\nSince \\(a\\) determines the shape of the tangent parabola, it also determines the curvature of the function at \\(x=x_0\\). If \\(a\\) is large at \\(x=x_0\\), the function will be sharply curved around that point. If \\(a\\) is small, the function will be very flat around \\(x=x_0\\). The sign of \\(a\\) will indicate whether the function is curved upward or downward. If \\(a>0\\) the function will be curved upward. If \\(a < 0\\) it’ll curve downward.\nIn our example \\(y=x^2\\), since \\(a=\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = 2 > 0\\), meaning the tangent parabola is just the function \\(y=x^2\\) itself. Of course it is. Since \\(a\\) is constant, the curvature for the parabola is the same everywhere.\nSince \\(a=2>0\\), the function \\(y=x^2\\) “bowls upward” everywhere. Functions that “bowl upward” everywhere like this are called convex function. If instead \\(a < 0\\) everywhere, e.g. like it would be for \\(y=-x^2\\), the function would “bowl downward” everywhere. These are called convave functions. Convex (and concave) functions are very important for machine learning and optimization more generally since they’re guaranteed to have a unique global minimum (or maximum). More on this in a future lesson.\nHere’s a more general example where the second derivative isn’t constant, \\(y = \\sin x\\). In this case, \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\cos x\\) and \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\\sin x\\). Suppose we want to get the tangent parabola at the point \\(x_0=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so \\(f(x_0)=-1\\), \\(\\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0)=0\\) and \\(\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x_0)=1\\). Then the tangent parabola is given by the equation\n\\[y = -1 + 0 \\cdot \\bigg(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\bigg) + \\bigg(x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\bigg)^2.\\]\nThis is an upward-sloping parabola with vertex at \\(\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, -1\\big)\\). Here’s a plot of this idea using the same helper function, but passing in f_parabola instead of f_tangent. Notice how the parabola approximates the function pretty well around the point \\(\\big(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, -1\\big)\\), but gets less and less accurate as we get away from that point. The fact that \\(a=1\\) here says that we should expect an upward sloping parabola with “unit curvature”, which is what we see.\n\nf = lambda x: np.sin(x)\ndfdx = lambda x: np.cos(x)\nd2fdx2 = lambda x: -np.sin(x)\n\nx0 = -np.pi / 2\nx = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.1)\nf_parabola = lambda x: f(x0) + dfdx(x0) * (x - x0) + 1/2 * d2fdx2(x0) * (x - x0) ** 2\nplot_tangent_curve(x, x0, f, f_parabola, xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(-1.5, 1.5), \n                   title=f'Tangent Parabola of $y=\\sin x$ at $(\\pi/2, -1)$')"

    "text": "Application: The Sigmoid Function\nTo illustrate how to calculate derivatives I’ll use a relevant example to machine learning, the sigmoid function. Recall the sigmoid function \\(y=\\sigma(x)\\) is defined by\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}.\\]\nIts shape looks like an S (hence the name), going from \\(y=0\\) at \\(x=-\\infty\\) to \\(y=1\\) at \\(x=\\infty\\).\n\nx = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.1)\nf = lambda x:  1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\nplot_function(x, f, xlim=(-10, 10), ylim=(-0.5, 1.5), ticks_every=[5, 0.5], title='Sigmoid Function')\n\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate the derivative of this function. First, though, let’s use some intuition and try to figure out what the derivative should be doing based on the shape of the sigmoid curve. When \\(x\\) is really negative, say \\(x < -5\\), the slope looks basically flat, hence the derivative should be zero there. Similarly, when \\(x\\) is really positive, say \\(x > 5\\), the derivative should be zero there too. Around \\(x=0\\), say \\(-1 < x < 1\\), the sigmoid looks kind of linear with positive slope. There we should expect the derivative to be positive, and roughly constant over that interval.\nTo verify this, let’s calculate the derivative of the sigmoid explicitly. There are a few ways to do this, but I’ll use the chain rule here. We have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\sigma(x) &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{d}{dx} (1 + e^{-x})^{-1} \\\\\n&= (-1) (1 + e^{-x})^{-2} \\frac{d}{dx} e^{-x} \\\\\n&= -(1 + e^{-x})^{-2} (-1) e^{-x} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{-x}}{(1 + e^{-x})^{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\frac{(1 + e^{-x}) - 1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\bigg(1-\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\bigg) \\\\\n&= \\sigma(x) \\big(1 - \\sigma(x)\\big).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLet’s look at this answer and verify it matches our intuition as to what the derivative of the sigmoid should be. - When \\(x < -5\\), \\(\\sigma(x) \\approx 0\\), hence \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\sigma(x) \\approx 0\\). - When \\(x > 5\\), \\(\\sigma(x) \\approx 1\\), so \\(1 - \\sigma(x) \\approx 0\\), and again \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\sigma(x) \\approx 0\\). - When \\(-1 < x < 1\\), \\(\\sigma(x) \\approx \\sigma(0) + \\frac{d}{dx}\\sigma(0) \\cdot (x-0) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\big(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\big) \\cdot x = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}x\\), which is a tangent line with a positive slope of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\nTo further verify the things look like a line around \\(x=0\\), we could look at the second derivative and verify it’s approximately zero in the region \\(-1 < x < 1\\). I’ll leave that exercise to you.\nThe sigmoid function shows up in machine learning when doing binary classification. If a problem can be classified into two classes, \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), the sigmoid can be used to model the probability of the input being in class \\(1\\). The closer the sigmoid is to \\(1\\), or equivalently the larger \\(x\\) is, the more likely the input is a \\(1\\). More on this in a future lesson.\nTo calculate the derivative of a function in sympy, use y.diff(x), which means “differentiate \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\)”.\nHere is a calculation of the derivative of the sigmoid function. I’ll also calculate the second derivative to show you how easy it is to do relative to the torture of trying to do it by hand.\n\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\n\n\ny = 1 / (1 + sp.exp(-x))\ny.diff(x)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{e^{- x}}{\\left(1 + e^{- x}\\right)^{2}}\\)\n\n\n\ny.diff(x).diff(x)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle - \\frac{e^{- x}}{\\left(1 + e^{- x}\\right)^{2}} + \\frac{2 e^{- 2 x}}{\\left(1 + e^{- x}\\right)^{3}}\\)"

    "text": "Area Under The Curve\nLet’s do an example. Suppose we’re interested in calculating the area under the curve \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) between two points, say \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=10\\). How would we go about this?\n\nf = lambda x: np.sqrt(x)\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\na, b = 0, 10\nplot_function_with_area(x, f, a=a, b=b, title='Area Under $y=\\sqrt{x}$ Between $0 \\leq x \\leq 10$')\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the easiest idea is to approximate the function by a shape that’s easier to calculate the area of, something you’ve seen in geometry, like a square or a triangle. A better idea is to take a bunch of simple shapes, calculate their areas, and add them together.\nLet’s try to do this using rectangles. Let’s approximate the function \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\) with \\(N=10\\) equally-spaced rectangles of varying heights \\(f(x)\\), where \\(x\\) is taken at each integer value \\(x=1,2,3,\\cdots,10\\). The width of each rectangle is \\(dx=\\frac{b-a}{N}=1\\). We know for rectangles their area is width times height, which in this case is \\(dx \\cdot f(x) = f(x)dx\\). Then the total area under the curve of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) would roughly be the sum of all these rectangle areas,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA &\\approx f(1)dx + f(2)dx + f(3)dx + \\cdots + f(10)dx \\\\\n&= \\big(f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \\cdots + f(10)\\big)\\cdot dx \\\\\n&= \\big(\\sqrt{1} + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\cdots + \\sqrt{10}\\big)\\cdot 1 \\\\\n&\\approx 22.468\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIt’s helpful to visualize what’s going on. I’ll plot this area approximation scheme by using the helper function plot_approximating_rectangles, which will show the plot of the curve and its approximating rectangles. It also prints out the approximating area calculated above.\n\nplot_approximating_rectangles(x, f, dx=1.0)\n\nApproximate Area: 22.468278186204103\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you stare at the plot you can see our area estimate is okay but not great. The rectangles are overestimating the area under the curve since they all have segments of area lying above the curve.\nThe problem was that the rectangles we used were too coarse. It’s better to use narrower rectangles, and more of them. What we need to do is make \\(dx\\) smaller by making \\(N\\) bigger. Let’s try using \\(N=50\\) rectangles of width \\(dx=0.2\\) instead and see how much the result improves.\n\nplot_approximating_rectangles(x, f, dx=0.2)\n\nApproximate Area: 21.380011968222313\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks better. We’re at \\(21.380\\) now. If you zoom in you’ll see we’re still overestimating the true area, but not by near as much as before. As we make \\(dx\\) smaller and smaller, and \\(N\\) bigger and bigger, this estimate will get better and better.\nThe exact area under this curve turns out to be\n\\[A = \\frac{20}{3}\\sqrt{10} \\approx 21.082.\\]\nThis will be the case when the rectangles are infinitesimally thin, so thin that the errors disappear and the area calculation becomes exact.\nLet’s try to calculate the approximating areas using smaller and smaller rectangles and see how close we can get to the exact answer. To do this, I’ll use a loop to calculate the area for successively smaller values of \\(dx\\).\n\nf = lambda x: np.sqrt(x)\n\nfor dx in [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]:\n    N = int(10 / dx)\n    xs = np.cumsum(dx * np.ones(N))\n    area = np.sum([f(x)*dx for x in xs])\n    print(f'N = {N:6d} \\t dx = {dx:8.4f} \\t A = {area:4f}')\n\nN =     10   dx =   1.0000   A = 22.468278\nN =    100   dx =   0.1000   A = 21.233523\nN =   1000   dx =   0.0100   A = 21.097456\nN =  10000   dx =   0.0010   A = 21.083426\nN = 100000   dx =   0.0001   A = 21.082009\n\n\nIt looks like if we want to get the correct answer \\(21.082\\) to 3 decimal places we’d need to use \\(N=100000\\) rectangles of width \\(dx=10^{-4}\\). In practice that’s an awful lot of terms to sum up. There are better ways to actually calculate these things numerically than just using the above definition (e.g. Simpson’s Rule), but I won’t go into those.\nLet’s generalize this. Suppose we want to calculate the area under the curve of some function \\(y=f(x)\\) between two points \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\). We can do this by taking \\(N\\) rectangles each of width \\(dx=\\frac{b-a}{N}\\) and height \\(f(x)dx\\) and summing up their areas. If \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{N-1}\\) are the points we’re evaluating the heights at, then \\[A \\approx f(x_0)dx + f(x_1)dx + f(x_2)dx + \\cdots + f(x_{N-1})dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(x_n) dx.\\]\nTo get the exact area, let’s allow \\(N\\) to get infinitely large, which also means \\(dx\\) will become infinitesimal. When we do this, it’s conventional to use a different symbol for the sum, the long-S symbol \\(\\int\\). Instead of writing\n\\[A = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(x_n) dx,\\]\nwe’d write \\[A = \\int_a^{b} f(x) dx.\\]\nRead this as “the integral from 0 to 10 of \\(f(x)dx\\)”. It’s called the definite integral of the function. In our example, this would be\n\\[A = \\int_0^{10} \\sqrt{x} dx.\\]\nOf course, this fancy notation doesn’t actually tell us anything new. We’re still just summing up the areas of a bunch of rectangles."

Since \\(5 \\div 2 = 2.5\\), the nearest rounded down integer is 2.\nIn math, this “nearest rounded down integer” 2 is usually called the floor of 2.5, and represented with the funny symbol \\(\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor.\\) Using this notation we can write the above integer division as \\[\\big\\lfloor \\frac{5}{2} \\big\\rfloor = 2.\\]\nIn python, integer division is done using the // operator, e.g. 5 // 2 = 2. I’ll usually write \\(5 \\ // \\ 2\\) instead of \\(\\big\\lfloor \\frac{5}{2} \\big\\rfloor\\) when it makes sense, \\[5 \\ // \\ 2 = \\big\\lfloor \\frac{5}{2} \\big\\rfloor = 2.\\]\n\n5 // 2\n\n2\n\n\nWe can also do regular division / with ints, but the output will not be an integer even if the answer should be, e.g. 4 / 2. Only integer division is guaranteed to return an integer. I’ll get to this shortly.\n\n4 / 2\ntype(4 / 2)\n\n2.0\n\n\nfloat\n\n\n\n4 // 2\ntype (4 // 2)\n\n2\n\n\nint\n\n\nDivision by zero is of course undefined for both division and integer division. In python it will always raise a ZeroDivisionError like so.\n\n4 / 0\n\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n\n\n4 // 0\n\nZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero"

    "text": "Representing Integers\nJust like every other data type, on a computer integers are actually represented internally as a sequence of bits. A bit is a “binary digit”, 0 or 1. A sequence of bits is just a sequence of zeros and ones, e.g. 0011001010 or 1001001.\nThe number of bits used to represent a piece of data is called its word size. If we use a word size of \\(n\\) bits to represent an integer, then there are \\(2^n\\) possible integer values we can represent.\nIf integers could only be positive or zero, representing them with bits would be easy. We could just convert them to binary and that’s it. To convert a non-negative integer to binary, we just need to keep dividing it by 2 and recording its remainder (0 or 1) at each step. The binary form is then just the sequence of remainders, written right to left. More generally, the binary sequence of some arbitrary number \\(x\\) is the sequence of coefficients \\(b_k=0,1\\) in the sum\n\\[x = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^\\infty b_k 2^k = \\cdots + b_2 2^2 + b_1 2^1 + b_0 2^0 + b_{-1} 2^{-1} + b_{-2} 2^{-2} + \\cdots.\\]\nHere’s an example. Suppose we wanted to represent the number \\(12\\) in binary. 1. \\(12 \\ // \\ 2 = 6\\) with a remainder of \\(0 = 12 \\text{ mod } 2\\), so the first bit from the right is then \\(0\\). 2. \\(6 \\ // \\ 2 = 3\\) with a remainder of \\(0 = 6 \\text{ mod } 2\\), so the next bit is \\(0\\). 3. \\(3 \\ // \\ 2 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(1 = 3 \\text{ mod } 2\\), so the next bit is \\(1\\). 4. \\(1 \\ // \\ 2 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1 = 1 \\text{ mod } 2\\), so the next bit is \\(1\\).\nSo the binary representation of \\(12\\) is \\(1100\\), which is the sequence of coefficients in the sum\n\\[12 = 1 \\cdot 2^{3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{1} + 0 \\cdot 2^{0}.\\]\nRather than keep doing these by hand, you can quickly convert a number to binary in python by using bin. It’ll return a string representing the binary sequence of that number, prepended with the special prefix 0b. To get back to the integer from, use int, passing in a base of 2.\n\nbin(12)\n\n'0b1100'\n\n\n\nint('0b110', 2)\n\n6\n\n\nThis representation works fine for non-negative integers, also called the unsigned integers in computer science. To represent an unsigned integer with \\(n\\) bits, just get its binary form and prepend it with enough zeros on the left until all \\(n\\) bits are used. For example, if we used 8-bit unsigned integers then \\(n=8\\), hence representing the number \\(12\\) would look like \\(00000110\\). Simple, right?\nUnsigned ints work fine if we never have to worry about negative numbers. But in general we do. These are called the signed integers in computer science. To represent signed ints, we need to use one of the bits to represent the sign. What we can do is reserve the left-most bit for the sign, \\(0\\) if the integers is positive or zero, \\(1\\) if the integer is negative.\nFor example, if we used 8-bit signed integers to represent \\(12\\), we’d again write \\(00000110\\), exactly as before. But this time it’s understood that left-most \\(0\\) is encoding the fact that \\(12\\) is positive. If instead we wanted to represent the number \\(-12\\) we’d need to flip that bit to a \\(1\\), so we’d get \\(10000110\\).\nLet’s now do an example of a simple integer system. Consider the system of 4-bit signed ints. In this simple system, \\(n=4\\) is the word size, and an integer \\(x\\) is represented with the sequence of bits\n\\[x \\equiv sb_1b_2b_3,\\]\nwhere \\(s\\) is the sign bit and \\(b_1b_2b_3\\) are the remaining 3 bits allowed to represent the numerical digits. This system can represent \\(2^4=16\\) possible values in the range \\([-2^3+1,2^3-1] = [-8,7]\\), given in the following table:\n\n\n\nInteger\nRepresentation\nInteger\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\n-0\n1000\n+0\n0000\n\n\n-1\n1001\n1\n0001\n\n\n-2\n1010\n2\n0010\n\n\n-3\n1011\n3\n0011\n\n\n-4\n1100\n4\n0100\n\n\n-5\n1101\n5\n0101\n\n\n-6\n1110\n6\n0110\n\n\n-7\n1111\n7\n0111\n\n\n\nNote the presence of \\(-0 \\equiv 1110\\) in the upper left. This is because the system as I’ve defined it leaves open the possibility of two zeros, \\(+0\\) and \\(-0\\), since for zero the sign bit is redundant. A way to get around this is to encode the negative numbers slightly differently, by not just setting the sign bit to one, but also inverting the remaining bits and subtracting one from them. This is called the two’s complement representation. It’s how most languages, including python, actually represent integers. I won’t go into this representation in any depth, except to say that it gets rid of the need for \\(-0\\) and replaces it with \\(-2^{n-1}\\).\nHere’s what that table looks like for 4-bit integers. It’s almost the same, except there’s no \\(-0\\), instead a \\(-8\\). Notice the positive integers look exactly the same. It’s only the negative integers that look different. For them, the right three bits get inverted and added with a one.\n\n\n\nInteger\nTwo’s Complement\nInteger\nTwo’s Complement\n\n\n\n\n-1\n1111\n0\n0000\n\n\n-2\n1110\n1\n0001\n\n\n-3\n1101\n2\n0010\n\n\n-4\n1100\n3\n0011\n\n\n-5\n1011\n4\n0100\n\n\n-6\n1010\n5\n0101\n\n\n-7\n1001\n6\n0110\n\n\n-8\n1000\n7\n0111\n\n\n\nIt’s worth visualizing what integers look like on the number line, if for nothing else than to compare it with what floats look like later on. Below I’ll plot what a 6-bit signed integer system would look like. Such a system should go from -32 to 31. I’ll to use the helper function plot_number_dist to do the plotting. As you’d expect, you just see a bunch of equally spaced points from -32 to 31.\n\nn = 6\nsix_bit_ints = range(-2**(n-1), 2**(n-1))\nplot_number_dist(six_bit_ints, title=f'Distribution of {n}-bit Signed Ints')\n\n\n\n\nIn python, integers are represented by default using a much bigger word size of \\(n=64\\) bits, called long integers, or int64 for short. This means (using two’s complement) we can represent \\(2^{64}=18446744073709551616\\) possible integer values in the range \\([-2^{63}, 2^{63}-1]\\).\nYou can see from this that 64-bit integers have a minimum integer allowed and a maximum integer allowed, which are\n\\[\\text{min_int}=-2^{63}=-9223372036854775808, \\qquad \\text{max_int}=2^{63}-1=9223372036854775807.\\]\nWhat I’ve said is technically only exactly true in older versions of pythons as well as other programming languages like C. It turns out newer versions of python have a few added tricks that allow you to represent essentially arbitrarily large integers. You can see this by comparing it to numpy’s internal int64 representation, which uses the C version. A numpy int64 outside the valid range will throw an overflow error.\n\nmin_int = -2 ** 63\nmax_int = 2 ** 63 - 1\n\n\nmin_int - 1\nnp.int64(min_int - 1)\n\n-9223372036854775809\n\n\nOverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long\n\n\n\nmax_int + 1\nnp.int64(max_int + 1)\n\n9223372036854775808\n\n\nOverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long"

To do this we need a new system of numbers that I’ll call floating point numbers, or floats, for reasons I’ll explain soon. Floats will be a computer’s best attempt to represent the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). They’ll represent real numbers only approximately with some specified precision.\nIn python, floats are builtin objects of type float. Floats obey pretty much the same operations that integers do with some minor exceptions: - Addition: \\(1.2 + 4.3 = 5.5\\). - Subtraction: \\(1.2 - 4.3 = -3.1\\). - Multiplication: \\(1.2 \\times 4.3 = 5.16\\). - Exponentiation: \\(4.3^2 = 18.49\\). - Remainder (or Modulo): \\(4.3 \\text{ mod } 1.2 = 0.7\\). - Integer Division: \\(4.3 \\ // \\ 1.2 = 3.0\\). - Division: \\(4.3 \\div 1.2\\).\nI’ll print these out in python to verify the answers are correct.\n\n1.2 + 4.3\n1.2 - 4.3\n1.2 * 4.3\n4.3 ** 2\n4.3 % 1.2\n4.3 // 1.2\n4.3 / 1.2\n\n5.5\n\n\n-3.0999999999999996\n\n\n5.159999999999999\n\n\n18.49\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n3.5833333333333335\n\n\nMost of them look right.

    "section": "Representing Floats",
    "text": "Representing Floats\nRepresenting real numbers on a computer is a lot more subtle than representing integers. Since a computer can only have a finite number of bits, they can’t represent infinitely many digits, e.g. in irrational numbers like \\(\\pi\\). Using finite word sizes will necessarily have to truncate real numbers to some number of decimal places. This truncation will create an error in the calculation called numerical roundoff.\nSo how should we represent a decimal number using \\(n\\) bits? As an example, let’s imagine we’re trying to represent the number \\(x=157.208\\). Perhaps the first thing you might think of is to use some number of those bits to represent the integer part, and some number to represent the fractional part. Suppose you have \\(n=16\\) bits available to represent \\(x\\). Then maybe you can use 8 bits for the integer part \\(157\\), and 8 bits for the fractional part \\(0.208\\). Converting both halves to binary, you’d get \\[157 \\equiv 10011101, \\quad 0.208 \\equiv 0011010100111111.\\]\nTruncating both sequences to 8 bits (from the left), you could thus adopt a convention that \\(157.208 \\equiv 10011101 \\ 00110101\\).\nThis system is an example of a fixed point representation. This has to do with the fact that we’re always using a fixed number of bits for the integer part, and a fixed number for the fractional part. The decimal point isn’t allowed to float, or move around to allocate more bits to the integer or fractional part depending which needs more precision. The decimal point is fixed.\nAs I’ve suggested, the fixed point representation seems to be limited and not terribly useful. If you need really high precision in the fractional part, your only option is to use a larger word size. If you’re dealing with really big numbers and don’t care much about the fractional part, you also need a larger word size so you don’t run out of numbers. A solution to this problem is to allow the decimal point to float. We won’t allocate a fixed number of bits to represent the integer or fractional parts. We’ll design it in such a way that larger numbers give the integer part more bits, and smaller numbers give the fractional part more bits.\nThe trick to allowing the decimal point to float is to represent not just the digits of a number but also its exponent. Think about scientific notation, where if you have a number like say \\(x=1015.23\\), you can write it as \\(1.01523 \\cdot 10^3\\), or 1.01523e3. That \\(3\\) is the exponent. It says something about how big the number is. What we can do is convert a number to scientific notation. Then use some number of bits to represent the exponent \\(3\\) and some to represent the remaining part \\(1.01523\\). This is essentially the whole idea behind floating point.\nIn floating point representation, instead of using scientific notation with powers of ten, it’s more typical to use powers of two. When using powers of two, the decimal part can always be scaled to be between 1 and 2, so they look like \\(1.567\\) or something like that. Since the \\(1.\\) part is always there, we can agree it’s always there, and only worry about representing the fractional part \\(0.567\\). We’ll call this term the mantissa. Denoting the sign bit as \\(s\\), the exponent as \\(e\\), and the mantissa as \\(m\\), we can thus right any decimal number \\(x\\) in a modified scientific notation of the form \\[x = (-1)^s \\cdot (1+m) \\cdot 2^{e}.\\] Once we’ve converted \\(x\\) to this form, all we need to do is to figure out how to represent \\(s\\), \\(m\\), and \\(e\\) using some number of bits of \\(n\\), called the floating point precision. Assume the \\(n\\) bits of precision allocate \\(1\\) bit for the sign, \\(n_e\\) bits for the exponent, and \\(n_m\\) bits for the mantissa, so \\(n=1+n_e+n_m\\).\nHere are the steps to convert a number \\(x\\) into its \\(n\\)-bit floating point representation. - Given some number \\(x\\), get its modified scientific notation form \\(x = (-1)^s \\cdot (1+m) \\cdot 2^e\\). - Determine the sign of \\(x\\). If negative, set the sign bit to \\(s=1\\), else default to \\(s=0\\). Set \\(x = |x|\\). - Keep performing the operation \\(x = x \\ // \\ 2\\) until \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 2\\). Keep track of the number of times you’re dividing, which is the exponent \\(e\\). - The remaining part will be some \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 2\\). Write it in the form \\(x = 1 + m\\), where \\(m\\) is the mantissa. - Convert the scientific notation form into a sequence of \\(n\\) bits, truncating where necessary. - For reasons I’ll describe in a second, it’s good to add a bias term \\(b\\) to the exponent \\(e\\) before converting the exponent to binary. Let \\(e'=e+b\\) be this modified exponent. - Convert each of \\(e'\\) and \\(m\\) into binary sequences, truncated to sizes \\(n_e\\), and \\(n_m\\) respectively. - Concatenate these binary sequences together to get a sequence of \\(n=1+n_e+n_m\\) total bits. By convention, assume the order of bit concatenation is the sign bit, then exponent bits, then the mantissa bits.\nThere are of course other ways you could do it, for example by storing the sequences in a different order. I’m just stating one common way it’s done.\nSince all of this must seem like Greek, here’s a quick example. Let’s consider the number \\(x=15.25\\). We’ll represent it using \\(n=8\\) bits of precision, where \\(n_e=4\\) is the number of exponent bits, \\(n_m=3\\) is the number of precision bits, and \\(b=10\\) is the bias. - Convert \\(x=15.25\\) to its modified scientific notation. - Since \\(x \\geq 0\\) the sign is positive, so \\(s=0\\). - Keep integer dividing \\(x\\) by \\(2\\) until it’s less than \\(2\\). It takes \\(e=3\\) divisions before \\(x<2\\). - We now have \\(x = 1.90625 \\cdot 2^3\\). The mantissa is then \\(m = (1.90625-1) = 0.90625\\). - In modified scientific notation form we now have \\(x=(-1)^0 \\cdot (1 + 0.90625) \\cdot 2^3\\). - Convert everything to binary. - Adding the bias to the exponent gives \\(e'=3+10=13\\). - Converting each piece to binary we get \\(e' = 13 \\equiv 1101\\), \\(m = 0.90625 \\equiv 11101\\). - Since \\(m\\) requires more than \\(n_m=3\\) bits to represent, truncate off the two right bits to get \\(m \\equiv 111\\). - This truncation will cause numerical roundoff, since \\(0.90625\\) truncates to \\(0.875\\). That’s an error of \\(0.03125\\) that gets permanently lost. - The final representation is thus \\(x \\equiv 0 \\ 1101 \\ 111\\).\nSo you can experiment, I wrote a helper function represent_as_float that lets you visualize this for different values of \\(x\\). Below I show the example I just calculated. I print out both the scientific notation form and its binary representation.\n\nrepresent_as_float(15.25, n=8, n_exp=4, n_man=3, bias=10)\n\nscientific notation: (-1)^0 * (1 + 0.90625) * 2^3\n8-bit floating point representation: 0 1101 111\n\n\nSo what’s going on with the bias term \\(b\\)? Why do we need it? The easiest answer to give is that without it, we can’t have negative exponents without having to use another sign bit for them. Consider a number like \\(x=0.5\\). In modified scientific notation this would look like \\(x=(-1)^0 \\cdot (1+0) \\cdot 2^{-1} = 2^{-1}\\), meaning its exponent would be \\(e=-1\\). Rather than have to keep yet another sign bit for the exponent, it’s easier to just add a bias term \\(b\\) that ensures the exponent \\(e'=e+b\\) is always non-negative. The higher the bias, the more precision we can show in the range \\(-1 < x < 1\\). The trade-off is that we lose precision for large values of \\(x\\).\nOn top of floats defined the way I mentioned, we also have some special numbers that get defined in a floating point system. These are \\(\\pm 0\\), \\(\\pm \\infty\\), and \\(\\text{NaN}\\) or “not a number”. Each of these numbers is allocated its own special sequence of bits, depending on the precision. - \\(+0\\) and \\(-0\\): These numbers are typically represented using a biased exponent \\(e'=0\\) (all zero bits) and a mantissa \\(m=0\\) (all zero bits). The sign bit is used to distinguish between \\(+0\\) and \\(-0\\). In our example, these would be \\(+0 \\equiv 0 \\ 0000 \\ 000\\) and \\(-0 \\equiv 1 \\ 0000 \\ 000\\). - \\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\): These numbers are typically represented using the max allowed exponent (all one bits) and a mantissa \\(m=0\\) (all zero bits). The sign bit is used to distinguish between \\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\). In our example, these would be \\(+\\infty \\equiv 0 \\ 1111 \\ 000\\) and \\(-\\infty \\equiv 1 \\ 1111 \\ 000\\). - \\(\\text{NaN}\\): This value is typically represented using the max allowed exponent (all one bits) and a non-zero \\(m \\neq 0\\). The sign bit is usually not used for \\(\\text{NaN}\\) values. Note this means we can have many different sequences that all represent \\(\\text{NaN}\\). In our example, any number of the form \\(\\text{NaN} \\equiv \\text{x} \\ 1111 \\ \\text{xxx}\\) would work.\nSo I can illustrate some points about how floating point numbers behave, I’m going to generate all possible \\(8\\)-bit floats (excluding the special numbers) and plot them on a number line, similar to what I did above with the \\(8\\)-bit signed integers. I’ll generate the floats using the using the helper function gen_all_floats, passing in the number of mantissa bits n_man=3, the number of exponent bits n_exp=4, and a bias of bias=10.\nFirst, I’ll use these numbers to print out some interesting statistics of this 8-bit floating point system.\n\neight_bit_floats = gen_all_floats(n=8, n_man=3, n_exp=4, bias=10)\nprint(f'Total number of 8-bit floats: {len(eight_bit_floats)}')\nprint(f'Most negative float: {min(eight_bit_floats)}')\nprint(f'Most positive float: {max(eight_bit_floats)}')\nprint(f'Smallest nonzero float: {min([x for x in eight_bit_floats if x > 0])}')\nprint(f'Machine Epsilon: {min([x for x in eight_bit_floats if x > 1]) - 1}')\n\nTotal number of 8-bit floats: 120\nMost negative float: -56.0\nMost positive float: 56.0\nSmallest nonzero float: 0.001953125\nMachine Epsilon: 0.25\n\n\nWe can see that this 8-bit system only contains 120 unique floats. We could practically list them all out. Just like with the integers, we see there’s a most negative float, \\(-56.0\\), and a most positive float, \\(56.0\\). The smallest float, i.e. the one closest to \\(0\\), is \\(0.001953125\\). Notice how much more precision the smallest float has than the largest ones do. The largest ones are basically whole numbers, while the smallest one has nine digits of precision. Evidently, floating point representations give much higher precision to numbers close to zero than to numbers far away from zero.\nWhat happens if you try to input a float larger than the max, in this case \\(56.0\\)? Typically it will overflow. This will result in either the system raising an error, or the number getting set to \\(+\\infty\\), in a sense getting “rounded up”. Similarly, for numbers more negative than the min, in this case \\(-56.0\\), either an overflow error will be raised, or the number will get “rounded down” to \\(-\\infty\\).\nYou have to be careful in overflow situations like this, especially when you don’t know for sure which of these your particular system will do. It’s amusing to note that python will raise an overflow error, but numpy will round to \\(\\pm \\infty\\). Two different conventions to worry about. Just as amusing, when dealing with signed integers, it’s numpy that will raise an error if you overflow, while python won’t care. One of those things…\nWhat happens when you try to input a float smaller than the smallest value, in this case \\(0.001953125\\)? In this case, the number is said to undeflow. Usually underflow won’t raise an error. The number will pretty much always just get set to \\(+0\\) (or \\(-0\\)). This is again something you have to worry about, especially if you’re dealing with small numbers in denominators, where they can lead to division by zero errors which do get raised.\nOverflow and underflow errors are some of the most common numerical bugs that occur in deep learning, and usually result from not handling floats correctly to begin with.\nI also printed out a special value called the machine epsilon. The machine epsilon, denoted \\(\\varepsilon_m\\), is defined as the smallest value in a floating point system that’s larger than \\(1\\). In some sense, \\(\\varepsilon_m\\) is a proxy for how finely you can represent numbers in a given \\(n\\)-bit floating point system. The smaller \\(\\varepsilon_m\\) the more precisely you can represent numbers, i.e. the more decimal places of precision you get access to. In our case, we get \\(\\varepsilon_m=0.25\\). This means numbers in 8-bit floating point tend to be \\(0.25\\) apart from each other on average, which means we can represent numbers in this system only with a measly 2-3 digits of precision.\nWith these numbers in hand let’s now plot their distribution on the number line. I’ll use the helper function plot_number_dist function to do this. Compare with the plot of the signed integers I did above.\n\nplot_number_dist(eight_bit_floats, title='Distribution of 8-bit Floats')\n\n\n\n\nNotice how different this plot is from the ones for the signed integers. With the integers, the points were equally spaced. Now points close to \\(0\\) are getting represented much closer together than points far from \\(0\\). There are \\(74\\) of the \\(120\\) total points showing up just in the range \\([-1,1]\\). That’s over half!. Meanwhile, only \\(22\\) points total show up in the combined ranges of \\([-60,-10]\\) and \\([10,60]\\). Very strange.\nFeel free to play around with different floating point systems by using different choices for n, n_man, n_exp, and bias. Be careful, however, not to make n_exp too large or you may crash the kernel…"

Double precision allows for a much larger range of numbers than 8-bit precision does: - The max value allowed is \\(2^{2^{n_e}-b} = 2^{1025} \\approx 10^{308}\\). - The min value allowed is \\(-2^{2^{n_e}-b} = -2^{1025} \\approx -10^{308}\\). - Numbers outside the range of about \\([-10^{308}, 10^{308}]\\) will overflow. - The smallest values allowed are (plus or minus) \\(2^{-b+1} = 2^{-1022} \\approx 10^{-308}\\). - Using subordinal numbers, the smallest values are (plus or minus) \\(2^{-b-n_m+1} = 2^{-1074} \\approx 10^{-324}\\). - Numbers inside the range of about \\([-10^{-308}, 10^{-308}]\\) will underflow. - Using subordinal numbers, this range is around \\([-10^{-324}, 10^{-324}]\\). - The machine epsilon is \\(\\varepsilon_m = 2^{-53} \\approx 10^{-16}\\). - Numbers requiring more than about 15-16 digits of precision will get truncated, resulting in numerical roundoff. - The special numbers \\(\\pm \\infty\\), \\(\\pm 0\\), and \\(\\text{NaN}\\) are represented similarly as before, except using 64 bits.\nTo illustrate the point regarding numerical roundoff, here’s what happens if we try to use double precision floating point to define the constant \\(\\pi\\) to its first 100 digits? Notice it just gets truncated to its first 15 digits. Double precision is unable to keep track of the other 85 digits. They just get lost to numerical roundoff.\n\npi = 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117068\npi\n\n3.141592653589793\n\n\nAnother thing to worry about is adding small numbers to medium to large sized numbers, e.g. \\(10 + 10^{-16}\\), which will just get rounded down to \\(10.0\\).\n\n10.0 + 1e-16\n\n10.0\n\n\nNumerical roundoff is often an issue when subtracting two floats. Here’s what happens when we try to subtract two numbers that should be equal, \\(x=0.1+0.2\\) and \\(y=0.3\\). Instead of \\(y-x=0\\), we get \\(y-x \\approx -5.55 \\cdot 10^{-17}\\). The problem comes from the calculation \\(x=0.1+0.2\\), which caused a slight loss of precision in \\(x\\).\n\nx = 0.1 + 0.2\ny = 0.3\ny - x\n\n-5.551115123125783e-17\n\n\nA major implication of these calculations is that you should never test floating points for exact equality because numerical roundoff can mess it up. If you’d tried to test something like (y - x) == 0.0, you’d have gotten the wrong answer. Instead, you want to test that y - x is less than some small number tol, called a tolerance, i.e. abs(y - x) < tol.\n\ny - x == 0.0\n\nFalse\n\n\n\ntol = 1e-5\nabs(y - x) < tol\n\nTrue\n\n\nNumerical roundoff explains why we got the weird results above when subtracting \\(1.2 - 4.3\\). The imperfect precision in the two numbers resulted in a numerical roundoff error, leading in the trailing \\(9\\)s that should’ve rounded up to \\(-3.1\\) exactly. In general, subtracting floats is one of the most dangerous operations to do, as it tends to lead to the highest loss of precision in calculations. The closer two numbers are to being equal the worse this loss of precision tends to get.\nI mentioned that double precision has a smallest number of \\(2^{-1022} \\approx 10^{-308}\\), but caveated that by saying that, by using a trick called subordinal numbers, we can get the smallest number down to about \\(10^{-324}\\). What did I mean by this? It turns out that the bits where the biased exponent \\(e'=0\\) (i.e. all exponent bits are zero) go mostly unused in the standard version of double precision. By using this zero exponent and allowing the mantissa \\(m\\) to take on all its possible values, we can get about \\(2^{52}\\) more values (since the mantissa has 52 bits). This lets us get all the way down to \\(2^{-1022} \\cdot 2^{-52} = 2^{-1074} \\approx 10^{-324}\\).\nPython (and numpy) by default implements double precision with subordinal numbers, as we can see.\n\n2 ** (-1074)\n2 ** (-1075)\n\n5e-324\n\n\n0.0\n\n\nThe special numbers \\(\\pm \\infty\\), \\(\\pm 0\\), and \\(\\text{NaN}\\) are also defined in double precision. In python (and numpy) they’re given by the following commands, - \\(\\infty\\): float('inf') or np.inf, - \\(-\\infty\\): float('-inf') or -np.inf, - \\(\\pm 0\\): 0, - \\(\\text{NaN}\\): float('nan') or np.nan.\n\nfloat('inf')\nnp.inf\n\ninf\n\n\ninf\n\n\n\nfloat('-inf')\n-np.inf\n\n-inf\n\n\n-inf\n\n\n\n0\n-0\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nfloat('nan')\nnp.nan\n\nnan\n\n\nnan\n\n\nYou may be curious what exactly \\(\\text{NaN}\\) (“not a number”) is and where it might show up. Basically, NaNs are used wherever values are undefined. Anytime an operation doesn’t return a sensible value it risks getting converted to NaN. One example is the operation \\(\\infty - \\infty = \\infty + (-\\infty)\\), which mathematically doesn’t make sense. No, it’s not zero…\n\nfloat('inf') + float('-inf')\nnp.inf - np.inf\n\nnan\n\n\nnan\n\n\nI’ll finish this section by mentioning that there are two other floating point representations worth being aware of: single precision (or float32), and half precision (or float16). Single precision uses 32 bits to represent a floating point number. Half precision uses 16 bits. It may seem strange to even bother having these less-precise precisions lying around, but they do have their uses. For example, half precision shows up in deep learning as a more efficient way to represent the weights of a neural network. Since half precision floats only take up 25% as many bits as default double precision floats do, using them can yield a 4x reduction in model memory sizes. We’ll see more on this later."

    "text": "Array Computing\nIn machine learning and most of scientific computing we’re not interested in operating on just single numbers at a time, but many numbers at a time. This is done using array operations. The most popular library in python for doing numerical computation on arrays is numpy.\nWhy not just do numerical computations in base python? After all, if we have large arrays of data we can just put them in a list. Consider the following example. Suppose we have two tables of data, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). Each table has \\(m=10\\) rows and \\(n=3\\) columns. The rows represent samples, e.g. measured in a lab, and the columns represent the variables, or features, being measured, call them \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), if you like. I’ll define these two tables using python lists A and B below.\nSuppose we wanted to add the elements in these two tables together, index by index, like this,\n\\[\nA[0][0] + B[0][0], \\quad A[0][1] + B[0][1], \\qquad  A[0][2] + B[0][2] \\\\\nA[1][0] + B[1][0], \\quad A[1][1] + B[1][1], \\qquad  A[1][2] + B[1][2] \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nA[9][0] + B[9][0], \\quad A[9][1] + B[9][1], \\qquad  A[9][2] + B[9][2].\n\\]\nIf we wanted to do this in python, we’d have to loop over all rows and columns and place the sums one-by-one inside an array \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), like this.\nNumpy makes this far easier to do. It implements element-wise array operatations, which allow us to operate on arrays with far fewer lines of code. In numpy, to perform the same adding operation we just did, we’d just add the two arrays together directly, \\(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\).\nTo use numpy operations we have to convert data into the native numpy data type, the numpy array. Do this by wrapping lists inside the function np.array. Once we’ve done this, we can just add them together in one line. This will simultaneously element-wise add the elements in the array so we don’t have to loop over anything.\nThis is really nice. We’ve managed to reduce a double foor loop of 8 lines of code down to just 1 line with no loops at all. Of course, there are loops happening in the background inside the numpy code, we just don’t see them.\nNumpy lets us do this with pretty much any arithmetic operation we can think of. We can element-wise add, subtract, multiply, or divide the two arrays. We can raise them to powers, exponentiate them, take their logarithms, etc. Just like we would do so with single numbers. In numpy, arrays become first class citizens, treated on the same footing as the simpler numerical data types int and float. This is called vectorization.\nIf vectorization just made code easier to read it would be a nice to have. But it’s more than this. In fact, vectorization also makes your code run much faster in many cases. Let’s see an example of this. I’ll again run the same operations above to add two arrays, but this time I’m going to profile the code in each case. That is, I’m going to time each operation over several runs and average the times. The ones with the lowest average time is faster than the slower one, obviously. To profile in a notebook, the easiest way is to use the %timeit magic command, which will do all this for you.\nEven with these small arrays the numpy vectorized array addition is almost 10 times faster than the python loop array addition. This difference becomes much more pronounced when arrays are larger. The arrays just considered are only of shape \\((10,3)\\). We can easily confirm this in numpy using the methods A.shape and B.shape.\nLet’s try to run the add operations on much larger arrays of shape \\((10000,100)\\). To do this quickly I’ll use np.random.rand(shape), which will sample an array with shape shape whose values are uniformly between 0 and 1. More on sampling in a future lesson. Running the profiling, we’re now running about 100 times faster using numpy vectorization compared to python loops.\nSo why is numpy vectorization so much faster than using native python loops? Because it turns out that numpy by and large doesn’t actually perform array operations in python! When array operations are done, numpy compiles them down to low-level C code and runs the operations there, where things are much faster.\nNot only that, numpy takes advantage of very efficient linear algebra functions written over the course of decades by smart people. These functions come from low-level FORTRAN and C libraries like BLAS and LAPACK. They’re hand-designed to take maximum advantage of computational speed-ups where available. These include things like parallelization, caching, and hardware vectorization operations. Native python doesn’t take advantage of any of these nice things. The moral is, if you want to run array operations efficiently, you need to use a numerical library like numpy or modern variants like pytorch.\nBroadcasting is a set of conventions for doing array operations on arrays with incompatible shapes. This may seem like a strange thing to do, but it turns out knowing how and when to broadcast can make your code much shorter, more readable, and efficient. All modern-day numerical libraries in python support broadcasting, including numpy, pytorch, tensorflow, etc. So it’s a useful thing to learn.\nWe’re usually interested in writing functions that run not just correctly, but efficiently. We want them to run as quickly as possible, and using as little memory as possible. When dealing with numbers, particularly floats, the usual way to measure how quickly a function will run is by counting floating point operations, or FLOPS for short. Memory is measured by counting the number of “words” each element in the function takes up.\nConsider a simple example. Suppose we want to element-wise multiply two 1D arrays x and y each of size \\(n\\) using the following function,\nLet’s ask two questions about this function: 1. How many FLOPs is the function doing? That is, how many arithmetic operations +, -, *, /, //, % did this function execute? 2. How many words of memory does the function use, ignoring the inputs, assuming each word has the same word size (e.g. 64 bits)?\nStarting with (1), let’s look at this function and see how many arithmetic operations, or FLOPs, each line is doing. 1. The function signature isn’t doing any arithmetic, so \\(0\\) FLOPs 2. Getting the length of an array isn’t doing any arithmetic, so \\(0\\) FLOPs 3. Here we’re looping over \\(n\\) terms. Each term has a single multiply. So there are \\(n\\) total FLOPs. 4. The return statement isn’t doing any arithmetic, so \\(0\\) FLOPs\nWhat about (2)? Let’s count how many words are being stored by each line of the function. 1. We’ll generally assume the function signature fits in \\(1\\) word of memory. This isn’t exactly true, but it’s a decent abstraction. 2. The length of an array is a single integer that’s pre-computed. Since an integer takes one word to store, this line is using \\(1\\) word of memory. 3. This line is using a list comprehension to create an array of n elements. Since each element is a single number (each of word size \\(1\\)) the array takes up \\(n\\) words of memory. 4. This line is just returning the variable z, which we’ve already counted, so no extra memory is being used.\nPutting it all together, the function is doing \\(0+0+n+0=n\\) total FLOPs and using \\(1 + 1 + n + 0=n+2\\) words of memory when inputs are size \\(n\\).\nTypically, we imagine \\(n\\) to be very large, say \\(n=10000\\) or something like that. When \\(n\\) gets large, the leading term tends to dominate the rest. So for example \\(n + 2 \\approx n\\). Since it’s the dominant term that determines almost of all of the function’s performance, we typically just drop the other terms and only keep the dominant term, while also ignoring any constant multiples. To indicate this is what we’re doing, it’s common to use what’s called asymptotic or big-O notation to represent performance. To indicate the leading term of \\(g(n)\\) is of order \\(f(n)\\), we’d write \\(O(f(n))\\). This is called the algorithmic complexity of the function. Here are some examples so you can get an idea of how to use this notation: - \\(n+2\\): The dominant term when \\(n\\) gets large is is \\(n\\), so the total complexity is \\(O(n)\\). - \\(10n^3 + n^2 + 7\\): The dominant term is \\(10n^3\\). Dropping constant multiples gets this down to \\(n^3\\). So \\(O(n^3)\\) is the total complexity. - \\(1 + 5n\\log n\\): The dominant term here is \\(5n\\log n\\). Dropping constants gives \\(O(n \\log n)\\) total complexity. - \\(2^n + 1000n^{1000}\\log n\\): The dominant term is the exponential \\(2^n\\), so the total complexity is \\(O(2^n)\\).\nHere’s a general rule of thumb for calculating complexities quickly. Terms on the left will always dominate terms to their right when \\(n\\) is large.\n\\[\\text{factorials} >> \\text{exponents} >> \\text{polynomials} >> \\text{logarithms} >> \\text{constants}.\\]\nIn the above example of element-wise multiplication, both FLOPs and memory are \\(O(n)\\). In general, element-wise operations will always be \\(O(n)\\) FLOPS and memory when the inputs are size \\(n\\). This is also true for multi-dimensional arrays containing \\(n\\) total elements. For example, element-wise adding two 2D arrays of shape \\((m,m)\\) will use \\(O(m^2)\\) FLOPs and memory since the arrays contain \\(n=m \\cdot m\\) total elements.\nAs a rough rule of thumb, complexities below \\(O(n^3)\\) are considered efficient. Complexities above \\(O(n^3)\\) are considered slow. The worst case of all is when it’s exponential or larger, like \\(O(2^n)\\) or \\(O(n!)\\). In general, we want to make complexities be as low as possible by using a more efficient algorithm that minimizes FLOPs and memory usage. Using FLOPS and memory complexity will allow us to estimate how efficiently machine learning algorithms are running in future lessons.\nBefore finishing up, I’ll mention that notions like FLOPs and words of memory are only abstractions to the real things we care about, how long a function actually takes to run (like in seconds), and how much memory is actually being used (like in bytes). When in doubt, if a function is running too slow, your best bet will be to run a profiler on the function to see how long it’s taking and how much memory it’s using. In jupyter, you can profile your code using one of the following magic commands: - %timeit: Runs the code a bunch of times and returns the average time it takes for the line to run. This is useful when you just want to get an idea how long something takes to run. - %prun: Runs a profiler on the code and reports various timing statistics on the entire function. - %lprun: Runs a profiler on the code, but reports timing statistics line-by-line, so you can see which lines of code are running slow. - This is the most useful profiler in my opinion since you can see which actual lines are running slow. - Need to install the line_profiler library first and load in the notebook with %load_ext line_profiler - %memit: Runs a memory profiler on the code, returning statistics on how much memory is being taken up. - Need to install the memory_profiler library first and load in the notebook with %load_ext memory_profiler - %mprun: Runs a memory profiler on the code, giving line-by-line statistics on how much memory each line is taking up. - Annoyingly, this only works for functions defined from a python script, not from a notebook - Need to install the memory_profiler library first and load in the notebook with%load_ext memory_profiler\nI’ll run each of these profilers on the above function element_wise_multiply so you can see how they work. To run it, you first need to pass in some inputs. I’ll define some reasonably large arrays for this. Notice, as you’d expect, it’s the line defining z that’s the worst offender. This is the idea that FLOPs and memory complexity already were capturing."

    "text": "Higher-Dimensional Arrays\nThe number of different dimensions an array has is called its dimension or rank. Equivalently, the rank or dimension of an array is just the length of its shape tuple. The arrays I showed above are examples of rank-2 or 2-dimensional arrays. We can define arrays with any number of dimensions we like. These arrays of different rank sometimes have special names: - A 0-dimensional (rank-0) array is called a scalar. These are single numbers. - A 1-dimensional (rank-1) array is called a vector. These are arrays with only one row. - A 2-dimensional (rank-2) array is called a matrix. These are arrays with multiple rows. - An array of dimension or rank 3 or higher is called a tensor. These are arrays with multiple matrices.\nMore on these when we get to linear algebra. Here are some examples so you can see what they look like. Note I’m using dtype=np.float64 to explicitly cast the values as float64 when defining the arrays. Numpy’s vectorization operations work for all of these arrays regardless of their shape.\n\nscalar = np.float64(5)\nscalar # 0-dimensional\n\n5.0\n\n\n\nvector = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float64)\nvector.shape # 1-dimensional\nvector\n\n(3,)\n\n\narray([1., 2., 3.])\n\n\n\nmatrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=np.float64)\nmatrix.shape # 2-dimensional\nmatrix\n\n(2, 3)\n\n\narray([[1., 2., 3.],\n       [4., 5., 6.]])\n\n\n\ntensor = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]], dtype=np.float64)\ntensor.shape # 3-dimensional\ntensor\n\n(2, 2, 2)\n\n\narray([[[1., 2.],\n        [3., 4.]],\n\n       [[5., 6.],\n        [7., 8.]]])\n\n\nNumpy also supports array aggregation operations as well. Suppose you have a matrix A and want to get the sum of the values in each row of A. To do this, you could use np.sum(A, axis=1), where axis is the index of the dimension you want to sum over (the columns in this case). This will return a vector where the value at index \\(i\\) is the sum of elements in row \\(i\\). To sum over all elements in the array, don’t pass anything to axis.\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [-1, -2, -3], [1, 0, -1]], dtype=np.float64)\nA\nnp.sum(A, axis=1)\nnp.sum(A)\n\narray([[ 1.,  2.,  3.],\n       [-1., -2., -3.],\n       [ 1.,  0., -1.]])\n\n\narray([ 6., -6.,  0.])\n\n\n0.0\n\n\nIndexing into numpy arrays like A is more powerful than with python lists. Instead of having to awkwardly index like A[1][0], write A[1, 0]. To get all values in column index 1, write A[:, 1]. To get just the first and last row, we could just pass the index we want in as a list like this, A[[0, -1], :].\n\nA[1][0]\nA[1, 0]\nA[:, 1]\nA[[0, -1], :]\n\n-1.0\n\n\n-1.0\n\n\narray([ 2., -2.,  0.])\n\n\narray([[ 1.,  2.,  3.],\n       [ 1.,  0., -1.]])\n\n\nNumpy also supports Boolean masks as indexes. Suppose we want to get all the positive elements x >= 0 in A. We could create a mask A > 0, and pass that into A as an index to pick out the positive elements only.\n\nmask = (A >= 0)\nmask\nA[mask]\n\narray([[ True,  True,  True],\n       [False, False, False],\n       [ True,  True, False]])\n\n\narray([1., 2., 3., 1., 0.])"

    "text": "Broadcasting Rules\nSuppose now that we have two arrays A and B of arbitrary shape and we want to operate on them, e.g. via the operations +, -, *, /, //, **. Here are the general broadcasting rules, quoted directly from the numpy documentation.\n\nNumpy DocumentationWhen operating on two arrays, numpy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing (i.e. rightmost) dimensions and works its way left. Two dimensions are compatible when 1. they are equal, or2. one of them is 1 If these conditions are not met, a ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together exception is thrown, indicating that the arrays have incompatible shapes. The size of the resulting array is the size that is not 1 along each axis of the inputs.\n\nLet’s look at an example. First, suppose A has shape (2, 2, 3) and B has shape (3,). Let’s suppose for simplicity that they’re both arrays of all ones.\nA: 2 , 2 , 3\nB:         3\n------------\nC: 2 , 2 , 3\nHere are the broadcasting steps that will take place. Note that only B will change in this example. A will stay fixed. - Numpy will start in the rightmost dimension, checking if they’re equal. - Begin with A of shape (2, 2, 3) and B of shape (3,). - In this case, the rightmost dimension is 3 in both arrays, so we have a match. - Moving left by one, B no longer has anymore dimensions, but A has two, each 2. These arrays are thus compatible. - Numpy will now copy B to the left in these new dimensions until it has the same shape as A.\n1. Copy values of B twice to get \n   B = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]] \n   with shape (2, 3)\n2. Copy values of B twice to get \n   B = [[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]], [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]] \n   with shape (2, 2, 3)\n\nThe shapes of A and B are now equal. The output array C will have shape (2, 2, 3).\n\nLet’s verify this is true on two simple arrays of ones. Let’s also print out what C looks like. Since only copying is taking place we should just be adding 2 arrays of ones, hence the output should sum 2 arrays of ones, giving one array C of twos.\n\nA = np.ones((2, 2, 3))\nB = np.ones(3,)\nA.shape, B.shape\n\nC = A + B\nC.shape\nC\n\n((2, 2, 3), (3,))\n\n\n(2, 2, 3)\n\n\narray([[[2., 2., 2.],\n        [2., 2., 2.]],\n\n       [[2., 2., 2.],\n        [2., 2., 2.]]])\n\n\nLet’s do one more example. Suppose now that A has shape (8, 1, 6, 1) and B has shape (7, 1, 5).\nA: 8 , 1 , 6 , 1\nB:     7 , 1 , 5\n----------------\nC: 8 , 7 , 6 , 5\nHere are the broadcasting steps that will take place. - Starting again from the right, dimensions 1 and 5 don’t match. But since A has a 1 rule (2) applies, so A will broadcast itself (i.e. copy its values) 5 times in this dimension to match B. - Moving left by one we get 6 and 1. Now B will broadcast itself in this dimension 6 times to match A. - Moving left again we get 1 and 7. Now A will broadcast itself in this dimension 7 times to match B. - Last, we get 8 in A and B is out of dimensions, so B will broadcast itself 8 times to match A. - The shapes of A and B are now equal. The output C thus has shape (8, 7, 6, 5).\nHere again is an example on two arrays of ones. Verify that the shapes come out right.\n\nA = np.ones((8, 1, 6, 1))\nB = np.ones((7, 1, 5))\nA.shape, B.shape\n\nC = A / B\nC.shape\n\n((8, 1, 6, 1), (7, 1, 5))\n\n\n(8, 7, 6, 5)\n\n\nThat’s pretty much all there is to broadcasting. It’s a systematic way of trying to copy the dimensions in each array until they both have the same shape. All this broadcasting is done under the hood for you when you try to operate on two arrays of different shapes. You don’t need to do anything but understand how the arrays get broadcast together so you can avoid errors in your calculations, sometimes very subtle errors.\nThis can be a bit confusing to understand if you’re not used to it. We’ll practice broadcasting a good bit so you can get the hang of it."

    "text": "Linear Systems\nYou’re certainly familiar by now with solving a simple linear equation. Suppose you need to solve the linear equation \\(ax=b\\) for \\(x\\). Provided \\(a \\neq 0\\), you can divide both sides by \\(a\\) to get\n\\[x = \\frac{b}{a} = a^{-1} b.\\]\nSuppose now you need to solve not just one, but 2 linear equations with 1 unknown \\(x\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   ax & {}={} & b  \\\\\n   cx & {}={} & d.\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\]\nThe first equation has the same solution as above, \\(x = a^{-1} b\\). The second equation has solution \\(x = c^{-1} d\\). If we want a solution \\(x\\) that satisifies both of these equations it’s going to be impossible unless \\(a^{-1} b = c^{-1} d\\), that is, if \\(ad = bc\\). If this relationship isn’t satisfied, there’s no single solution that will solve both of these equations.\nStepping up now, suppose you again have 2 linear equations, but this time with two unknowns \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here’s an example,\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   x & {}+{} &  y & {}={} & 2  \\\\\n   x & {}-{} &  y & {}={} & 0.\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\]\nLet’s try to find a pair \\((x,y)\\) that will solve both of these equations simultaneously. This is a pretty simple system to solve. If you stare at equation two, you’ll immediately see it implies \\(x=y\\). Plugging this into equation one then gives \\(x + x = 2\\), or \\(x=1\\). The pair that solves this system is thus \\(x=y=1\\). In fact, this is the only solution to this linear system. No other choice of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will work.\nThis is an example of a linear system of equations with 2 linear equations and 2 unknowns. These have the form\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   ax & {}+{} &  by & {}={} & e \\\\\n   cx & {}+{} &  dy & {}={} & f.\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\]\nSystems with 2 equations and 2 unknowns will always have a unique solution provided the coefficients \\(ad \\neq bc\\), given by\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{de-bf}{ad-bc} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{af-ce}{ad-bc}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIf you don’t believe me, plug these in to check they satisfy the linear system. Or you can solve the linear system by substitution again. Or just ask sympy.\nIt’s worth plotting what these equations look like to try to visualize what’s going on. In the simple case of 2 variables we can do that. In the above example with solution \\(x=y=1\\), solving each equation for \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\) gives\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= 2-x \\\\\ny &= x.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIf we plot these two lines, the point where they intersect is \\((1,1)\\), i.e. the solution to the system found above. Feel free to play around with different choices of \\(a,b,c,d,e,f\\) to see what happens. What you’re doing is varying the slopes and intercepts of both of the lines. Varying any of these will change the location of the point of intersection, i.e. the solution to the linear system. The special case where both have the same slope is when \\(ad=bc\\). This is when the two lines are parallel. Since parallel lines don’t intersect, such a system would have no solution.\nSuppose now you have a system of 2 equations with 3 unknowns \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). For example,\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   x & {}+{} &  y & {}+{} & z {}={} & 2  \\\\\n   x & {}-{} &  y & {}+{} & z {}={} & 0.\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\]\nDoes this system have a solution that satisfies both equations? Clearly it does. If we set \\(z=0\\) then the original solution \\(x=y=1\\) still works, so \\(x=1, y=1, z=0\\) is a solution to this system. But is it the only solution? No, any solution of the form\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx=1-t, \\\\\ny=1, \\\\\nz=t.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nwill work for any real number \\(t\\). If you don’t believe me, pick any choice of \\(t\\) you want and plug it in, and it’ll solve this system. Said differently, this system has infinitely many solutions.\nThis fact will be true for any system of 2 equations with 3 unknowns. The system is underdetermined, meaning it has too many variables to solve for. There will always be one that’s free, in the sense that we can set it to be whatever we want.\nHere’s a plot of what this situation looks like. Since there are 3 variables the space is now 3-dimensional, so I’ll have to use a 3D plot. Notice that now we don’t have 2 intersecting lines, but 2 intersecting planes. Two planes intersect at a line, not a point. Any point on this line is a valid solution to this underdetermined linear system.\nLet’s now step up to a system with 3 linear equations and 3 unknowns. For example, take the following,\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{3}\n   3x & {}+{} &  2y & {}+{} & z {}={} & 0 \\\\\n   x & {}+{} &  y & {}-{} & z {}={} & 1 \\\\\n   x & {}-{} &  3y & {}-{} & z {}={} & -3 \\\\\n\\end{alignat*}.\n\\]\nAgain using substitution, you can iteratively solve each equation one by one to check that this system has exactly one solution when \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(y=1\\), and \\(z=-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nTo visualize what’s going on here, again realize we’re in 3 dimensions since there are 3 variables. Each equation in the system again defines a plane. Solving each for \\(z=f(x,y)\\), the three planes are given by\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nz &= -3x - 2y + 0, \\\\\nz &= x + y - 1, \\\\\nz &= 4 .\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe can plot these planes and see if they intersect, and roughly where they intersect. It may be a little hard to visualize, but you should see the planes all intersect at a point, namely the red dot at \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(y=1\\), and \\(z=-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nEvery linear system of 3 equations with 3 unknowns will look like this. The only time there won’t be a solution is when any two planes are parallel to each other. Note now it only takes any two being parallel for there to be no solution, not all of them.\nIf we like, we could again outright solve for the solutions of a general \\(3 \\times 3\\) linear system, but the solutions will look far more complex since there are now 12 coefficients \\(a, b, c, \\cdots, k, l\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{3}\n   ax & {}+{} &  by & {}+{} & cz {}={} & j \\\\\n   dx & {}+{} &  ey & {}+{} & fz {}={} & k \\\\\n   gx & {}+{} &  hy & {}+{} & iz {}={} & l \\\\\n\\end{alignat*}.\n\\]\nHere’s what sympy gives as the solution to this system. Notice again that each term depends on the same denominator. When that denominator is zero the system won’t have a solution.\nThese denominators keep showing up for square-shaped systems like this. They’re called determinants. In the \\(1 \\times 1\\) case \\(x=\\frac{b}{a}\\), so the determinant is just the denominator \\(D=a\\). For the \\(2 \\times 2\\) system the determinant is \\(D = ad-bc\\). For the \\(3 \\times 3\\) system it’s a more complicated expression, but still just a polynomial function of all of the coefficients on the left-hand side,\n\\[D = aei - afh - bdi + bfg + cdh - ceg.\\]\nWhen \\(D \\neq 0\\) these kinds of linear systems evidently have unique solutions. When \\(D=0\\) they have no solution at all since the denominators blow up. This is when two of the lines or planes are parallel to each other. This is a general pattern for any \\(n \\times n\\) linear system.\nI could keep stepping up like this, going to 4 linear equations, 5 linear equations, etc. But you should start to see the idea by now. Suppose we have a system of \\(m\\) linear equations with \\(n\\) unknown variables \\(x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_{n-1}\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c<{x_1} C c<{x_2} C c C c<{x_n} C l}\na_{0,0}x_0 & + & a_{0,1}x_1 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{0,n-1}x_{n-1} & = & b_0 \\\\\na_{1,0}x_0 & + & a_{1,1}x_1 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{1,n-1}x_{n-1} & = & b_1 \\\\\n\\vdots    &   & \\vdots    &   &  \\ddots  &   & \\quad \\vdots    &   & \\vdots\\\\\na_{m-1,0}x_0 & + & a_{m-1,1}x_1 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{m-1,n-1}x_{n-1} & = & b_{m-1} \\\\\n\\end{array}.\n\\]\nWe can classify the solutions of an arbitrary \\(m \\times n\\) linear system as follows: - If the linear system is square, i.e. \\(m=n\\), then the system will have - A unique solution if the determinant is nonzero, - If the determinant is zero, the system will have - Infinitely many solutions if all the equations are multiples of each other, - No solution otherwise. - If the linear system is underdetermined, i.e. \\(m < n\\), then the system will have infinitely many solutions. - If the linear system is overdetermined, i.e. \\(m > n\\), then the system will have no solutions.\nGraphically, a unique solution means that the \\(n\\) hyperplanes defined by the \\(n\\) linear equations all intersect at a single point \\((x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_n)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Think of a hyperplane as an \\(n\\)-dimensional generalization of a plane. If any of two hyperplanes are parallel in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), there will be no solution.\nThese systems of linear equations are incredibly tedious to write out and analyze as is for all but the simplest cases of like two or three equations. There’s a cleaner notation for working with these things. Here’s what we can do. We have 3 separate types of objects showing up in these equations: - The \\(m \\cdot n\\) coefficients \\(a_{0,0}, \\ a_{0,1}, \\ \\cdots, \\ a_{m-1,n-1}\\). - The \\(n\\) unknown variables \\(x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_{n-1}\\). - The \\(m\\) constant terms \\(b_0, b_1, \\cdots, b_{m-1}\\).\nLet’s put each of these three objects inside their own arrays and write the linear system as\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{0,0} & a_{0,1} & \\cdots & a_{0,n-1} \\\\\na_{1,0} & a_{1,1} & \\cdots & a_{1,n-1} \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots    \\\\\na_{m-1,0} & a_{m-1,1} & \\cdots & a_{m-1,n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb_0 \\\\ b_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe’ll define this notation to mean exactly the same thing as writing out the full system of linear equations. The array of coefficients is a rank-2 array of shape \\((m,n)\\). We’ll call this an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix, denoted by a bold-face \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The array of unknowns is a rank-2 array of shape \\((n,1)\\). Though technically also a matrix, we’ll call an array of this shape a column vector of size \\(n\\), denoted by a bold-face \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). The array of constants is also a rank-2 array of shape \\((m,1)\\). We’ll call this a column vector of size \\(m\\), denoted by a bold-face \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). In this sleek notation, our complicated system of \\(m\\) linear equations with \\(n\\) unknowns can be written\n\\[\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}.\\]\nFor example, the 3 systems we considered above can be written in matrix-vector notation as\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   x & {}+{} &  y & {}={} & 2  \\\\\n   x & {}-{} &  y & {}={} & 0\n\\end{alignat*} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   x & {}+{} &  y & {}+{} & z {}={} & 2  \\\\\n   x & {}-{} &  y & {}+{} & z {}={} & 0\n\\end{alignat*} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   x {}={} & 2  \\\\\n   x {}={} & 0\n\\end{alignat*} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nIt may not be at all obvious, but having written a linear system as a matrix-vector equation, I’ve implicitly defined a new kind of array multiplication. To see this, I’ll define a new column vector that I’ll call \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) whose elements are just the left-hand side of the linear system when written out,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{0,0}x_0 & + & a_{0,1}x_1 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{0,n-1}x_{n-1} \\\\\na_{1,0}x_0 & + & a_{1,1}x_1 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{1,n-1}x_{n-1} \\\\\n\\vdots    &   & \\vdots    &   &  \\ddots  &   & \\quad \\vdots     \\\\\na_{m-1,0}x_0 & + & a_{m-1,1}x_1 & + & \\cdots & + & a_{m-1,n-1}x_{n-1} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nSetting the \\(i\\)th row of \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) equal to the \\(i\\)th row of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must imply that each \\(b_i\\) can be written\n\\[b_i = a_{i,0}x_0 + a_{i,1}x_1 + \\cdots + a_{i,n-1}x_{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{i,k}x_k.\\]\nThat is, each constant term \\(b_i\\) is the sum of the products of the \\(i\\)th row of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) with the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). This is matrix-vector multiplication, a special case of matrix multiplication, which I’ll get to shortly.\nHere’s a quick example, where a \\(2 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is matrix multiplied with a size \\(3\\) vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). For each row we’re element-wise multiplying that row of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) with the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and then summing up the terms. The output will be the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) of size \\(2\\).\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n4 \\cdot 1 + 5 \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6 \\\\\n15\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{b}.\n\\]\nHere’s a better way of thinking about what matrix-vector multiplication is. Notice that the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) consists of \\(n\\) columns each containing \\(m\\) elements. We can think of each of these \\(n\\) columns as a vector of size \\(m\\). They’re called the column vectors of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). If \\(\\mathbf{a}_0, \\mathbf{a}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{a}_{n-1}\\) are the \\(n\\) column vectors of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), we can write\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{a}_0 & \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{a}_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nIn the previous example, the column vectors of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) are the three size-2 vectors\n\\[\\mathbf{a}_0 = \\binom{1}{4}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\binom{2}{5}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\binom{3}{6}.\\]\nIn this notation, matrix-vector multiplication is just a sum of the column vectors of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), but with each column \\(\\mathbf{a}_j\\) weighted by some \\(x_j\\),\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{a}_0 & \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{a}_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_0 \\\\\nx_1 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nx_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix} =\nx_0 \\mathbf{a}_0 + x_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\cdots x_{n-1} \\mathbf{a}_{n-1}.\n\\]\nThis weighted sum of vectors on the right-hand side is called a linear combination. A linear combination is a weighted sum of a bunch of vectors. That is, the matrix-vector product \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) is a linear combination of the column vectors of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), weighted by the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). In the above example, this would look like\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot \\binom{1}{4} + 1 \\cdot \\binom{2}{5} + 1 \\cdot \\binom{3}{6} = \\binom{1+2+3}{4+5+6} = \\binom{6}{15}.\n\\]\nWhile I’m on the topic, I’ll go ahead and define matrix multiplication for two matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) as well. If \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(m \\times n\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is \\(n \\times p\\), define the matrix product \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\) as the \\(m \\times p\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) whose elements are given by\n\\[C_{i,j} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A_{i,k} B_{k,j} = A_{i,0} B_{0,j} + A_{i,1} B_{1,j} + \\cdots + A_{i,n-1} B_{n-1,j}.\\]\nMatrix multiplication is always expressed symbolically by directly concatenating the two matrix symbols next to each other like \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\). We’d never use a multiplication symbol between them since those are often used to represent other kinds of multiplication schemes like element-wise multiplication or convolutions. Further, matrix multiplication is only defined when the numbers of columns in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) equals the number of rows of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). We say matrices satisfying this condition are compatible. If they can’t be multiplied, they’re called incompatible.\nIn words, matrix multiplication is the process where you take a row \\(i\\) of the left matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), element-wise multiply it with a column \\(j\\) of the right matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), and then sum up the results to get the entry \\(C_{i,j}\\) of the output matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). Doing this for all pairs of rows and columns will fill in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\).\nHere’s an example where \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(3 \\times 3\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is \\(3 \\times 2\\). The output matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) will be \\(3 \\times 2\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\color{red}{1} & \\color{red}{2} & \\color{red}{3} \\\\\n    \\color{blue}{4} & \\color{blue}{5} & \\color{blue}{6} \\\\\n    \\color{green}{7} & \\color{green}{8} & \\color{green}{9} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\color{orange}{6} & \\color{purple}{5} \\\\\n    \\color{orange}{4} & \\color{purple}{3} \\\\\n    \\color{orange}{2} & \\color{purple}{1} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n   \\color{red}{1} \\cdot \\color{orange}{6} + \\color{red}{2} \\cdot \\color{orange}{4} + \\color{red}{3} \\cdot \\color{orange}{2} & \\color{red}{1} \\cdot \\color{purple}{5} + \\color{red}{2} \\cdot \\color{purple}{3} + \\color{red}{3} \\cdot \\color{purple}{1} \\\\\n   \\color{blue}{4} \\cdot \\color{orange}{6} + \\color{blue}{5} \\cdot \\color{orange}{4} + \\color{blue}{6} \\cdot \\color{orange}{2} & \\color{blue}{4} \\cdot \\color{purple}{5} + \\color{blue}{5} \\cdot \\color{purple}{3} + \\color{blue}{6} \\cdot \\color{purple}{1} \\\\\n   \\color{green}{7} \\cdot \\color{orange}{6} + \\color{green}{8} \\cdot \\color{orange}{4} + \\color{green}{9} \\cdot \\color{orange}{2} & \\color{green}{7} \\cdot \\color{purple}{5} + \\color{green}{8} \\cdot \\color{purple}{3} + \\color{green}{9} \\cdot \\color{purple}{1} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n   20 & 14 \\\\\n   56 & 41 \\\\\n   92 & 68 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nAside: If you’re still having a hard time picturing what matrix multiplication is doing, you may find this online visualization tool useful.\nNote that matrix multiplication does not commute. That is, we can’t swap the order of the two matrices being multiplied, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B} \\neq \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A}\\). Try to multiply the above example in the opposite order and see what happens. The two matrices won’t even be compatible anymore. However, matrix multiplication is associative, which means you can group parentheses just like you ordinarily would. For example, multiplying three matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}\\) could be done by multiplying either the first two, and then the last; or the last two, and then the first. That is,\n\\[\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C}) = (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{C}.\\]\nMatrix multiplication can be thought of as a kind of extension to matrix-vector multiplication, where instead of just trying to solve one linear system, we’re trying to solve a bunch of them in parallel, but all having the same coefficients \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Suppose we want to simultaneously solve the systems of equations\n\\[\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}_0=\\mathbf{b}_0, \\quad \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}_1=\\mathbf{b}_1, \\quad \\cdots, \\quad \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}_{p-1}=\\mathbf{b}_{p-1}.\\]\nWhat we can do is create two matrices \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) by making column vectors out of each \\(\\mathbf{x}_j\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_j\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{X} &=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{x}_0 & \\mathbf{x}_1 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{x}_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\\n\\mathbf{B} &=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{b}_0 & \\mathbf{b}_1 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{b}_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThen the bunch of linear systems we’re trying to solve is just the matrix product \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{B}\\). Each column \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}_j=\\mathbf{b}_j\\) can again be thought of as a linear combination of the columns of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), but with each column weighted by its own vector \\(\\mathbf{x}_j\\)."

    "text": "Matrix Multiplication Algorithm\nMatrix multiplication is perhaps the single most important mathematical operation in machine learning. It’s so important I’m going to write a function to code it from scratch before showing how to do it in numpy. I’ll also analyze the speed of the algorithm in FLOPS and the memory in terms of word size. Algorithmically, all matrix multiplication is doing is looping over every single element of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and performing the sum-product calculation above for each \\(C_{i,j}\\). Here’s a function matmul that takes in two numpy arrays A and B and multiplies them, returning the product C if the dimensions are compatible.\n\ndef matmul(A, B):\n    assert A.shape[1] == B.shape[0]\n    m, n, p = A.shape[0], A.shape[1], B.shape[1]\n    C = np.zeros((m, p))\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(p):\n            for k in range(n):\n                C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n    return C\n\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]); print(f'A = \\n{A}')\nB = np.array([[6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]]); print(f'B = \\n{B}')\nC = matmul(A, B); print(f'C = AB = \\n{C.astype(A.dtype)}')\n\nA = \n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]\n [7 8 9]]\nB = \n[[6 5]\n [4 3]\n [2 1]]\nC = AB = \n[[20 14]\n [56 41]\n [92 68]]\n\n\nLet’s take a quick look at what this function is doing complexity wise. First off, we’re pre-computing the output matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). That’ll contribute \\(O(mp)\\) memory since \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is \\(m \\times p\\). All of the FLOPS are happening inside the double loop over \\(m\\) and \\(p\\). For each \\(i,j\\) pair, the function performing \\(n\\) total multiplications and \\(n-1\\) total additions, i.e. \\(2n-1\\) FLOPs per \\(i,j\\) pair. Since we’re doing this \\(m \\times p\\) times, that gives \\(m \\cdot p \\cdot (2n-1)\\) total FLOPS, or to leading order \\(O(mnp)\\) FLOPS. Matrix multiplication is an example of a cubic time algorithm since if \\(n=m=p\\) we’d have a cubic leading order of \\(O(n^3)\\) FLOPS.\nAside: People have found algorithms that can matrix multiply somewhat faster than cubic time. For example, Strassen’s algorithm can matrix multiply in about \\(O(n^{2.8})\\) time. Matrices that have special forms, e.g. banded matrices or sparse matrices, have special algorithms that can multiply them even faster, for example by using the Fast Fourier Transform. These special algorithms have their uses, but it remains the case that practically speaking most matrix multiplication is best done using the naive cubic time algorithm.\nCubic time may seem fast, but it’s really not unless the matrices are relatively small (say \\(n \\leq 1000\\) or so). For this reason, a lot of effort has gone into making matrix multiplication run highly efficiently on hardware, mostly by parallelizing the function above, optimizing blocks to take advantage of meory, and compiling operations down to low-level C or FORTRAN code. In fact, it’s no exaggeration to say that the entire reason the deep learning revolution over the past decade happened because people found ways to multiply matrices much faster by using GPUs.\nAnyway, we’d never want to implement matrix multiplication natively in python like this. It’s far too slow. In practice we’d use np.matmul(A, B) to matrix multiply. A cleaner notation is to use the special @ symbol for matrix multiplication, in which case we can just write A @ B.\n\nA @ B\n\narray([[20, 14],\n       [56, 41],\n       [92, 68]])"

    "text": "Multiplying Multiple Matrices\nWhat about multiplying three or more matrices together. I already said matrix multiplication is associative, so we can multiply any two at a time we like and get the same answer. However, there are often computational advantages to multiplying them together in some particular sequence. For example, suppose we wanted to multiply \\(\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C}\\). Suppose, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(m \\times n\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is \\(n \\times p\\), and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is \\(p \\times q\\). No matter which order we do it, the output \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) will have size \\(m \\times q\\). But there are two ways we could do this multiplication. 1. \\(\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C})\\): In this case, the \\(\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C}\\) computation requires \\(nq(2p-1)\\) FLOPS, and then the \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{E}\\) computation requires \\(mq(2n-1)\\) FLOPS. The total is thus the sum of these two, i.e. \\[nq(2p-1) + mq(2n-1) = O(npq+mnq) \\ \\ \\text{FLOPS}.\\]\n\n\\(\\mathbf{D} = (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{C}\\): In this case, the \\(\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\) computation requires \\(mp(2n-1)\\) FLOPS, and then the \\(\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{C}\\) computation requires \\(mq(2n-1)\\) FLOPS. The total is thus the sum of these two, i.e. \\[mq(2p-1) + mp(2n-1) = O(mpq+mnp) \\ \\ \\text{FLOPS}.\\]\n\nLet’s put some numbers in to make it clear what’s going on. Suppose \\(m=1000\\), \\(n=2\\), \\(p=100\\), and \\(q=100\\). Then the first case takes\n\\[nq(2p-1) + mq(2n-1) = 339800 \\ \\ \\text{FLOPS},\\]\nwhile the second case takes a staggering\n\\[mq(2p-1) + mp(2n-1) = 20200000 \\ \\ \\text{FLOPS}.\\]\nIt would thus behoove us in this case to multiply the matrices in the first order to save on computation, \\(\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C})\\). Here’s a programmatic way to see this.\n\nm = 1000\nn = 2\np = 100\nq = 100\n\nprint(f'A(BC): {m * q * (2 * n - 1) + n * q * (2 * p - 1)} FLOPS')\nprint(f'(AB)C: {m * p * (2 * n - 1) + m * q * (2 * p - 1)} FLOPS')\n\nA(BC): 339800 FLOPS\n(AB)C: 20200000 FLOPS\n\n\nThe same issues extend to multiplying together arbitrarily many matrices. You can save a lot of compute by first taking time to find the optimal order to multiply them together before doing the computation. Don’t just naively multiply them in order. Numpy has a function np.linalg.multi_dot that can do this for you. If you pass in a list of matrices, it’ll multiply them together in the most efficient order to help save on computation. Here’s an example. I’ll profile the different ways we can do the \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C}\\) example above. Notice that indeed \\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C})\\) is much faster than \\((\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{C}\\). The multi_dot solution is roughly as fast as the \\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{C})\\) solution, but it does take slightly longer because it first calculates the optimal ordering, which adds a little bit of time.\n\nA = np.random.rand(m, n)\nB = np.random.rand(n, p)\nC = np.random.rand(p, q)\n\n\n%timeit A @ (B @ C)\n\n65.5 µs ± 659 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)\n\n\n\n%timeit (A @ B) @ C\n\n640 µs ± 137 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n\n\n\n%timeit np.linalg.multi_dot([A, B, C])\n\n78.2 µs ± 79 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)"

It’s only defined when the shapes of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are equal (or can be broadcasted to be equal).\nIt’s important to mind the difference between matrix multiplication and element-wise multiplication of matrices.

How do we go about this? Let’s look at the simplest cases when \\(n=1,2\\) and see if we can spot a pattern.\nWhen \\(n=1\\), we’re just solving the single linear equation \\(ax=b\\), where \\(a,x,b\\) are all real numbers. In this case it’s easy, as dividing both sides by \\(a\\) gives \\(x = a^{-1}b\\) when \\(a \\neq 0\\).\nWhen \\(n=2\\), we’re solving the \\(2 \\times 2\\) linear system\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   ax & {}+{} &  by & {}={} & e \\\\\n   cx & {}+{} &  dy & {}={} & f,\n\\end{alignat*}\n\\]\nwhich I showed before was given by\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{de-bf}{ad-bc} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{af-ce}{ad-bc},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nprovided \\(ad \\neq bc\\). Now, if I rewrite this equation in matrix-vector notation, I’d get\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ne \\\\\nf\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{b},\n\\]\nand the solutions would look like\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{de-bf}{ad-bc} \\\\\n\\frac{af-ce}{ad-bc}\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{d}{ad-bc} & -\\frac{b}{ad-bc} \\\\\n-\\frac{c}{ad-bc} & \\frac{a}{ad-bc}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ne \\\\\nf\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{b}.\n\\]\nThe matrix on the right I’m calling \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) because it looks something like the \\(x=a^{-1}b\\) equation from the \\(n=1\\) case. You can verify it gives the right result by matrix multiplying \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) with \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and confirming it does indeed give the equations for \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nBut what exactly does it mean to talk about “dividing by” a matrix? In the \\(n=1\\) case, dividing by \\(a\\) just means that \\(a a^{-1} = 1\\). That is, the two values undo each other when multiplied together. Let’s see what undoing a matrix would look like by matrix multiplying \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) when \\(n=2\\),\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^{-1} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{d}{ad-bc} & -\\frac{b}{ad-bc} \\\\\n-\\frac{c}{ad-bc} & \\frac{a}{ad-bc}\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{ad}{ad-bc}-\\frac{bc}{ad-bc} & -\\frac{ab}{ad-bc}+\\frac{ab}{ad-bc} \\\\\n\\frac{cd}{ad-bc}-\\frac{dc}{ad-bc} & -\\frac{cb}{ad-bc}+\\frac{da}{ad-bc}\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{ad-bc}{ad-bc} & \\frac{ab-ab}{ad-bc} \\\\\n\\frac{cd-cd}{ad-bc} & \\frac{ad-bc}{ad-bc}\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{I}.\n\\]\nThe matrix on the right \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) seems to behave kind of like the \\(1\\) in the \\(a a^{-1} = 1\\) case. This matrix is called the \\(2 \\times 2\\) identity matrix. The matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) is called the inverse of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The denominator \\(D=ad-bc\\) is again the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), usually denoted \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A})\\) or often more simply just \\(|\\mathbf{A}|\\) when the meaning is clear,\n\\[|\\mathbf{A}| = \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = ad - bc.\\]\nThe inverse \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) will only exist when \\(|\\mathbf{A}| = ad-bc \\neq 0\\). If \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) doesn’t exist, neither does a solution to the linear system, since we can’t solve for \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nThe exact same idea extends to arbitrary \\(n \\times n\\) systems as well. The \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the matrix whose values are \\(1\\) when \\(i=j\\) and \\(0\\) when \\(i \\neq j\\). The terms in a matrix when \\(i=j\\) are called the diagonal of the matrix. The terms when \\(i \\neq j\\) are called the off-diagonals. Thus, the identity matrix is the matrix that takes on the value \\(1\\) on the diagonal and \\(0\\) on the off-diagonals.\nIf we’d like to solve the system \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\\), we could find the inverse of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) somehow, and then get the solution \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by writing \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{b}\\), provided its determinant \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) \\neq 0\\). A matrix with non-zero determinant is called invertible. Invertible matrices have inverses. A matrix with zero determinant are called singular. Singular matrices can’t be inverted.\nOf course, it’s no longer obvious at all how to even find \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) or \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A})\\) when \\(n>2\\). Thankfully we don’t need to cover this for machine learning purposes. I’ll just mention that there are efficient algorithms for solving large linear systems like this. You can use np.linalg.solve(A, b) to do this, provided \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) can be inverted. Here’s an example of solving a \\(3 \\times 3\\) linear system. You can also get the inverse directly by using np.linalg.inv(A), though you’d rarely actually want to do this. It turns out matrix inversion is a very numerically unstable operation. Try to avoid explicitly calculating matrix inverses if you can.\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]); print(f'A = \\n{A}')\nb = np.array([[1], [1], [1]]); print(f'b = \\n{b}')\nx = np.linalg.solve(A, b); print(f'x = \\n{x}')\n\nA = \n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]\n [7 8 9]]\nb = \n[[1]\n [1]\n [1]]\nx = \n[[ 0.2]\n [-1.4]\n [ 1.2]]"

    "text": "Rectangular Systems\nWhat about when \\(m \\neq n\\)? Things become more interesting then. If \\(m < n\\) the linear system is under-determined, and will have infinitely many solutions. In this case, there are infinitely many ways to “invert” \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). We just need to find any one of them that will work. If \\(m > n\\) the linear system is over-determined, and will have no exact solution. We can however find an approximate solution by looking for the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) that most nearly solves the linear system. In both cases, a generalization of the inverse exists, called the pseudoinverse.\nHere’s how to find out what the pseudoinverse should be. Let’s define a matrix similar to \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), but with its rows and columns swapped, called the transpose of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The transpose of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), denoted by the symbol \\(\\mathbf{A}^\\top\\), is defined by the relationship \\(A_{i,j}^\\top = A_{j,i}\\).

The key thing to notice is that if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(m \\times n\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}^\\top\\) is \\(n \\times m\\). This means that the product of the two is square since \\(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A}^\\top\\) is \\(m \\times m\\). Note a square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows as columns, i.e. with \\(m=n\\). The product in the opposite order is square too since \\(\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(n \\times n\\).\nHere’s an example. In numpy, we can use np.transpose(A), or more simply A.T to get the transpose of a matrix.

Thus, this modified linear system has a solution given by\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{b}.\\]\nThis looks kind of like \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{b}\\). If we define the pseudoinverse \\(\\mathbf{A}^+\\) by\n\\[\\mathbf{A}^+ = (\\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\mathbf{A}^\\top,\\]\nthen we could write the solution to this modified linear system as\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{A}^+ \\mathbf{b}.\\]\nThe solution we get from this is called the least squares solution to \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\\).

    "text": "Geometry of Vectors\nI’ve introduced matrices and vectors so far kind of organically as the natural way to write and solve systems of linear equations. They’re good for a lot more than solving linear systems, however. For one thing, they possess important geometric properties. I’m now going to re-define the concepts covered so far, but in more geometric terms.\nSo where do matrices fit into all this vector space stuff? It turns out that matrices correspond to functions between vectors to vectors. These are called linear maps. A linear map is a vector-valued function from one vector space to another that preserves the properties of vectors. In \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), a linear map is a function between vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}=(w_x,w_y)\\) of the form\n\\[\\mathbf{w} = (w_x, w_y) = (av_x + bv_y, cv_x + dv_y) = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}).\\]\nThat is, each component of the output vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is a linear combination of the input vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Now, if you stare at this function for a little bit, you should see that this kind of looks like a \\(2 \\times 2\\) system of linear equations,\n\\[\n\\begin{alignat*}{2}\n   av_x & {}+{} &  bv_y & {}={} & w_x \\\\\n   cv_x & {}+{} &  dv_y & {}={} & w_y\n\\end{alignat*}.\n\\]\nThis of course means the linear map is equivalent to a matrix-vector equation. If we identify \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) with \\(2 \\times 1\\) column vectors, and define a \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\nthen the linear map \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v})\\) is equivalent to the matrix-vector equation \\(\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\), or\n\\[\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}.\\]\nIn fact, every linear map \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v})\\) can be identified with some matrix equation \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\). Knowing \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (in some basis) is equivalent to knowing the linear map itself.\nBut why are linear maps important? The main reason is that they preserve linear structure. Notice that I can define a line through any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by scaling it with some parameter \\(t\\). If I apply a linear map to this line I’d get \\(\\mathbf{F}(t\\mathbf{v}) = t\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v})\\). Check it yourself from the definition. Said differently, linear maps map lines to lines, thus preserving the linear structure of the vector space. The new line won’t usually be the original line. It may get rotated. But it’s still a line.\nLet’s try to visualize what a linear map does by defining a particular \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and seeing how it acts on inputs \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\nWhy stop there? Let’s apply the linear map a whole bunch of times recursively and see what happens to the output vectors \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). I’ll plot each of the \\(k=63\\) vectors in the following sequence, \\[\\mathbf{v}, \\ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}, \\ \\mathbf{A}^2\\mathbf{v}, \\ \\cdots, \\ \\mathbf{A}^{63}\\mathbf{v}.\\]\nNote each power \\(\\mathbf{A}^j\\) here is a matrix power, defined by applying matrix multiplication over and over \\(k\\) times. It’s not the element-wise power.\nFor the particular values in this plot I’ll choose \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -0.1 \\\\ 0.1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). The original vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is colored black. Notice that each linear map is slowly rotating the vector counterclockwise and also slightly stretching it. By the time it gets back around it’s already maybe 40% longer than the original vector.\nIn fact, every linear map between two vectors in the plane will do at least one of these two things: rotate the input vector in the plane, or stretch (or shrink) it by some factor. I just chose a particularly nice one to plot.\nWhat do you suppose the transpose of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) does in this particular example? That is, suppose you use \\(\\mathbf{A}^\\top\\) instead. Notice what would happen is the minus sign would move from the upper right to the lower left. You can verify that this will just cause the matrix to spin vectors the other way, clockwise instead of counterclockwise.\nIn fact, what I’ve just shown is a special case of what happens when you compose linear maps: Composition of linear maps is equivalent to matrix multiplication. If \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{v}\\) are two linear maps, then their composite function \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{v}))\\) is another linear map given by\n\\[\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{G}(\\mathbf{v})) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{v}.\\]\nThis is perhaps the real reason matrix multiplication is important. Because linear maps are important, and applying multiple linear maps in sequence is just matrix multiplication.\nTwo other special linear maps worth being aware of are the identity map and the inverse map. The identity map is the map \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{v}\\). What does it do to \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)? Let’s see. We can get the identity matrix in numpy using np.eye(n), where n is the dimension (in this case 2).\nIt looks like nothing is happening. That is, \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}\\). You can verify this by writing this out in components and seeing what the matrix-vector product is. In fact, \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}\\) is always true, for any dimension, and any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\nAside: Notice that I had to flatten the vectors here to do the plot. That’s because I’ve sneakily defined vectors in two different ways, first as a column vector of shape \\((2,1)\\) and then as a flat vector of shape \\((2,)\\).\nThe inverse map is just the linear map that undoes the original linear map \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\), i.e.\n\\[\\mathbf{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}.\\]\nYou can see what this does by applying the two maps in succession. Here’s an example of doing this with the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\) and the \\(90^\\circ\\) rotation matrix\n\\[\\mathbf{A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\nApplying \\(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v})\\) followed by \\(\\mathbf{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{v})\\) just gives the same vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) back. This just follows from the fact that \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{I}\\), so the composition \\(\\mathbf{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}))=\\mathbf{v}\\).\nI’ll close this section by mentioning that we’re often not interested in linear maps in practice, but affine maps. Recall that a simple linear function might have the form \\(y=ax\\). An affine function has the form \\(y=ax+b\\). That is, an affine function is just a linear function shifted upward by \\(b\\). The same idea extends to maps between vectors.\nAn affine map is just a linear map shifted by some constant translation vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{b}.\\]\nThe only difference between an affine map and a linear map is that vectors will get not just scaled and rotated, but also translated by \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). In machine learning, the translation vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) often called a bias vector.\nHere’s a plot of what this looks like using the same previous matrix, and a bias vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=(-1, -1)\\). I want to show that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{b}\\) is really just the vector \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\), but translated so its tail lies at \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). To do so, I’ll plot the vector \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{b}\\) with its tail at the origin, as well as the vector \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}\\) with its tail shifted to the point \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). What matters is that the head of both of these vectors is the same. The main vector \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{b}\\) is shown in red.\nIt may seem like everything I’ve said is special for the case of \\(n=2\\) dimensions, but it’s really not. Every single thing I’ve said extends exactly how you’d expect to vectors of arbitrary size \\(n\\). The only difference now is that you can’t visualize the stuff anymore. You just have to trust the math. I’ll restate all of the definitions from above here, but for \\(n\\)-dimensional vector spaces instead.\nA vector of size \\(n\\) can be defined as a 1-dimensional array of real numbers \\(x_0,x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_{n-1}\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = (x_0,x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_{n-1}).\\]\nVectors can be added together, and multiplied by scalars. Vector addition is defined element-wise. If \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are two vectors, then\n\\[\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y} = (x_0+y_0, x_1+y_1, \\cdots, x_{n-1}+y_{n-1}).\\]\nTo keep a running example through this section, I’ll use numpy to create two vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) each of size \\(n=10\\). Here’s their vector sum.\nScalar multiplication is defined similarly. If \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is some scalar and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is some vector, then\n\\[c\\mathbf{x} = (cx_0,cx_1,\\cdots,cx_{n-1}).\\]\nVectors of size \\(n\\) live in the \\(n\\)-dimensional vector space \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). By definition, any linear combination of two vectors must also live in the same vector space. That is, if \\(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) are two vectors and \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) are two scalars, then \\(a \\mathbf{x} + b \\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\).\nThe dot product or inner product between two vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) of size \\(n\\) is defined as their sum product, i.e.\n\\[\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = x_0y_0 + x_1y_1 + \\cdots + x_{n-1}y_{n-1}.\\]\nThe norm (technically the 2-norm) of a vector is defined as the square root of its dot product with itself, i.e.\n\\[||\\mathbf{x}|| = ||\\mathbf{x}||_2 = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}} = \\sqrt{x_0^2 + x_1^2 + \\cdots + x_{n-1}^2}.\\]\nThis is just the \\(n\\)-dimensional generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem. We can also consider other \\(p\\) norms as well. In particular, the cases when \\(p=1\\) and \\(p=\\infty\\) sometimes show up in applications,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n||\\mathbf{x}||_1 &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |x_i| = |x_0| + |x_1| + \\cdots + |x_{n-1}|, \\\\\n||\\mathbf{x}||_\\infty &= \\max_{i=0,\\cdots,n-1} |x_i| = \\max\\big(|x_0|, |x_1|, \\cdots, |x_{n-1}|\\big).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIt will always be the case that \\(||\\mathbf{x}||_1 \\geq ||\\mathbf{x}||_2 \\geq ||\\mathbf{x}||_\\infty\\).\nThe distance $ d(, )$ between two vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is just the norm of their difference vector,\n\\[d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = ||\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|| = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\sqrt{(x_i-y_i)^2} = \\sqrt{(x_0-y_0)^2 + (x_1-y_1)^2 + \\cdots + (x_{n-1}-y_{n-1})^2}.\\]\nWe can define the angle between any two vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) of size \\(n\\) by making use of the same identity for the dot product, which still holds in \\(n\\) dimensions,\n\\[\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = ||\\mathbf{x}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{y}|| \\cos \\theta.\\]\nUsing this identity, we can define the cosine similarity \\(\\cos(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})\\) by solving for \\(\\cos \\theta\\),\n\\[\\cos(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}}{||\\mathbf{x}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{y}||}.\\]\nThe dot product is a measure of how similar two vectors are, and the cosine similarity is a normalized measure of how similar two vectors are, since dividing by the norms forces \\(-1 \\leq \\cos \\theta \\leq 1\\).\nA set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{k-1}\\) is linearly independent if no one vector is a linear combination of the rest,\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_j \\neq \\sum_{i \\neq j} c_i \\mathbf{x}_j.\\]\nIf one vector is a linear combination of the rest, they’re linearly dependent. If there are exactly \\(n\\) linear independent vectors in the set, it’s called a basis.\nWe can define the standard basis on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) with the following complete set of size \\(n\\) unit vectors,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{e}_0 &= (1, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0), \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_1 &= (0, 1, 0, \\cdots, 0), \\\\\n\\vdots \\ &= \\qquad \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_{n-1} &= (0, 0, 0, \\cdots, 1).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe standard basis is an orthonormal basis since each vector is a unit vector and they’re all mutually orthogonal, i.e.\n\\[\n\\mathbf{e}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_j = \\delta_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & i = j, \\\\\n0 & i \\neq j.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nNotation: The symbol \\(\\delta_{ij}\\) is called the Kronecker delta. It’s just a shorthand way of writing something is \\(1\\) if \\(i=j\\) and \\(0\\) if \\(i \\neq j\\).\nIf a basis is orthonormal, any vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) can be decomposed into a linear combination of the basis elements by taking the dot product \\(\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_i\\). For the standard basis, these just give the vector components \\(x_i\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_i) \\mathbf{e}_i = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i \\mathbf{e}_i = x_0 \\mathbf{e}_0 + x_1 \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots x_{n-1} \\mathbf{e}_{n-1}.\\]\nEach term \\(x_i \\mathbf{e}_i\\) in the sum corresponds to the projection of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) onto the \\(i\\)th axis. Each axis in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is still a single line, but now there are \\(n\\) of these axis lines, all perpendicular to each other.\nA linear map is a vector-valued function \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})\\) between vector spaces that preserves the linear structure of the spaces. In general, \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) need not be in the same vector spaces. Either way, a linear map can always be expressed as a matrix-vector equation \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is some \\(m \\times n\\) matrix. More generally, an affine map is a linear map shifted by some bias vector \\(\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\). Affine maps can always be expressed as a shifted matrix-vector equation, \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}\\).\nAside: Roughly speaking a neural network is just a composite function of successive affine maps, except that one adds a nonlinearity function \\(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})\\) in between each successive affine map to make it nonlinear. For example, the following nonlinear function could represent a “one hidden layer” neural network,\n\\[\\mathbf{y} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2\\big(\\mathbf{A}_2\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1(\\mathbf{A}_1\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}_1) + \\mathbf{b}_2\\big).\\]\nThe nonlinearity functions that get chosen are rarely exotic. Most of the time they’re all just the ReLU function \\(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x})=\\max(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{x})\\), except in the output layer. The coefficients in the matrices and bias vectors become the parameters of the network and get learned from the training data.\nJust as with linear maps in the plane, linear maps in higher dimensions always preserve lines. Not just lines in fact, but planes and hyperplanes as well. These generalizations of lines are called linear subspaces. Linear subspaces will always be hyperplanes in \\(n\\)-dimensional space that pass through the origin. Think of them as planes passing through the origin, but in more dimensions. If the hyperplane spanned by \\(\\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{k-1}\\) is some \\(k\\)-dimensional linear subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), then its image under the linear map will be a new \\(k\\)-dimensional linear subspace in \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) (if \\(k \\leq m\\), otherwise it’ll just be the full vector space \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) itself). Any linear combination of vectors in a given subspace will stay inside that subspace. It’s closed under vector space operations. For all practical purposes it’s a new vector space \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\) unto itself."

    "text": "Visualizing Vectors\nLet’s go back to the simple 2-dimensional case. Imagine you have a point in the xy-plane, call it \\((x,y)\\). Now, we can think of this as a single point, but we can also imagine it differently. Suppose there was an arrow pointing from the origin \\((0,0)\\) to the point \\((x,y)\\). For example, if the point was \\((1,1)\\), this arrow might look like this.\n\npoint = np.array([1, 1])\nplot_vectors(point, title=f'Arrow From $(0,0)$ To $(1,1)$', ticks_every=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the point \\((x,y)\\), the arrow \\((x,y)\\) has both a length and a direction. Its length is given by the Pythagorean Theorem. If the triangle has base \\(x\\) and height \\(y\\), then the length of the arrow is just its hypotenuse, i.e. \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\). The direction of the arrow is its angle \\(\\theta\\) with respect to the x-axis. This angle is just given by the inverse tangent of height over base, i.e. \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\big(\\frac{y}{x}\\big)\\).\nIn the example plotted, the length is \\(r=\\sqrt{1+1}=\\sqrt{2}\\), and the angle is \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(1) = 45^\\circ\\). These two values uniquely specify the arrow, assuming it starts at the origin. If we know the length and direction, we know exactly which arrow we’re talking about.\nWhat I’ve just shown is another way to define a vector. A vector is an arrow in the plane. Said differently, a vector is just a point that’s also been endowed with a length (or magnitude) and a direction. The x and y values are called components of a vector. Usually we’ll write a vector in bold-face and its components in regular type but with subscripts indicating which component. For example, \\(\\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y)\\). Here’s the same arrow I plotted above, but explicitly labeled as a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\). Its components are \\(v_x=1\\) and \\(v_y=1\\).\n\nv = np.array([1, 1])\nplot_vectors(v, title='$\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)$', labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$'], ticks_every=0.5)\n\n\n\n\nNotation: It’s common to represent vectors in a few different ways depending on the situation. One way to represent a vector is as a column vector. This is what I did when doing matrix-vector multiplication. Another way, what I just introduced, is a flat vector, or a 1-dimensional array. This is more common when thinking about a vector geometrically. Yet another way is to think of a vector as a row vector, which is the transpose of a column vector. All of these representations conceptually represent the same object, but their shapes are different. Here’s an example: The size-2 vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\) can be written in 3 different but all equivalent ways:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{Flat vector of shape } (2,): \\mathbf{v} = (1,1), \\\\\n&\\text{Column vector of shape } (2,1): \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\\n&\\text{Row vector of shape } (1,2): \\mathbf{v}^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nBe careful when working with vectors in code to make sure you’re using the right shapes for the right situation or you’ll get shape mismatch errors (or worse a silent bug)."

    "text": "Vector Operations\nThe magnitude, or length, of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is typically denoted by the symbol \\(||\\mathbf{v}||\\), called a norm,\n\\[||\\mathbf{v}|| = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}.\\]\nIn the above example with \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\), its norm is \\(||\\mathbf{v}||=\\sqrt{1+1}=\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\).\nNotice that the norm must be non-negative since it’s the square root of a sum of squares, i.e. \\(||\\mathbf{v}|| \\geq 0\\). This should sound right, after all negative lengths don’t make any sense.\nWhat happens if we scale a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by some scalar \\(c\\)? By the rules of scalar-vector multiplication, the new vector should be \\(c\\mathbf{v}=(cx,cy)\\). Since the new vector has length \\(||c\\mathbf{v}||\\), a little math shows that\n\\[||c\\mathbf{v}|| = \\sqrt{(cv_x)^2 + (cv_y)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2(v_x^2 + v_y^2)} = |c| \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = |c| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{v}||.\\]\nThat is, the re-scaled vector \\(c\\mathbf{v}\\) just gets its length re-scaled by \\(c\\). That’s why \\(c\\) is called a scalar. It rescales vectors. Notice if \\(c\\) is negative, the length stays the same, but the direction gets reversed \\(180^\\circ\\) since in that case \\(c\\mathbf{v} = c(v_x, v_y) = -|c|(v_x,v_y)\\).\nHere’s what vector scaling looks like geometrically. I’ll plot the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\) again, but scaled by two numbers, one \\(c=2\\), the other \\(c=-1\\). When \\(c=2\\), the vector just doubles its length. That’s the light blue arrow. When \\(c=-1\\), the vector reverses its direction \\(180^\\circ\\), but maintains its length since \\(|c|=1\\). That’s the light orange arrow.\n\nv = np.array([1, 1])\nplot_vectors([v, -v, 2*v], xlim=(-2,3), ylim=(-2,3), title=f'Scaling Vectors', headwidth=7, ticks_every=1,\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$-\\mathbf{v}$', '$2\\mathbf{v}$'], \n             colors=['black', 'salmon', 'steelblue'],\n             text_offsets=[[-0.2, 0.2], [-0.2, 0.4], [-0.2, 0.2]])\n\n\n\n\nWhat does adding two vectors do? Let \\(\\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}=(w_x,w_y)\\) be two vectors in the plane. Then their sum is \\(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w} = (v_x+w_x,v_y+w_y)\\). I’ll plot an example below with \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}=(1,3)\\).

Let me plot it slightly differently. What I’ll do is plot the vectors “head to tail” by taking the tail of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and placing it at the head of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Then the head of this translated \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) vector points at the head of the sum \\(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}\\). We can do this “head to tail” stuff since the base of a vector is irrelevant. We can place the arrow wherever we want as long as we maintain its length and direction.\nInformally speaking, to add two vectors, just stack them on top of each other head to tail, and draw an arrow from the starting point to the ending point. You can geometrically add arbitrarily many vectors this way, not just two. Just keep stacking them.\n\nplot_vectors([v, w, v + w], xlim=(0, 3), ylim=(0, 5), title=f'Adding Two Vectors (Head to Tail)',\n             colors=['salmon', 'steelblue', 'black'],\n             tails=[[0, 0], [v[0], v[1]], [0, 0]], text_offsets=[[-0.5, -0.85], [0.5, -0.8], [-1.4, -1.6]],\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$\\mathbf{w}$', '$\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}$'],\n             zorders = [0, 1, 2], ticks_every=1)\n\n\n\n\nThe norm satisfies what’s known as the triangle inequality: If \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) are two vectors, then the length of their sum is less than the sum of their individual lengths, i.e.\n\\[||\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}|| \\leq ||\\mathbf{v}|| + ||\\mathbf{w}||.\\]\nYou can see this by staring at the plot above. The added lengths of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is larger than the length of their sum \\(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}\\). In fact, the only time the lengths will be equal is if \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) are parallel to each other.\nWhat about subtracting two vectors? By combining the rules for scalar multiplication and vector addition, you can convince yourself that the difference of two vectors is also element-wise,\n\\[\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{w} = (v_x-w_x,v_y-w_y).\\]\nTo visualize what subtracting two vectors looks like, notice we can write subtraction as a sum like this, \\(\\mathbf{w} + (\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{v}\\). Now use the same trick for adding vectors, only this time placing \\((\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{w})\\) at the head of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), and noticing that it points to the sum of the two, which is \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).\nAn easy way to remember what subtracting two vectors looks like is to connect the two vectors you’re subtracting with a line segment, and place the head on the first vector. This trick will never fail you.\n\nv = np.array([1, 1])\nw = np.array([1, 3])\nplot_vectors([v, w, v - w], xlim=(-0.5, 1.5), ylim=(-0.5, 3.5), title=f'Subtracting Two Vectors', headwidth=4,\n             ticks_every=1, colors=['salmon', 'steelblue', 'black'],\n             tails=[[0, 0], [0, 0], [w[0], w[1]]], text_offsets=[[-0.5, -0.8], [-0.5, -1], [1.05, 3.8]],\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$\\mathbf{w}$', '$\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{w}$'])"

These follow straight from the definition. - The dot product of a vector with itself is nonnegative: \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\geq 0\\). - It commutes: \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\). - It distributes over scalar multiplication: \\(c\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot c\\mathbf{w} = c(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w})\\). - It distributes over vector addition: \\((\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\).\nNotation: The dot product is often written in several different ways in different fields. Another notation arises by thinking of the dot product as the matrix multiplication of a row vector \\(\\mathbf{v}^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix}v_x & v_y \\end{pmatrix}\\) with a column vector \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} w_x \\\\ w_y \\end{pmatrix}\\). In that case,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{w} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_x & v_y \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} w_x \\\\ w_y \\end{pmatrix}\n= v_x w_x + v_y w_y = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}.\n\\]\nThis is the most commonly used notation for the dot product in machine learning. I’ll use it more frequently after this lesson.\nWe can write the norm or length of a vector in terms of the dot product. Observe that by dotting \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) with itself, I get\n\\[\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = v_x^2 + v_y^2 = ||\\mathbf{v}||^2.\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, you can see that the norm or length of a vector is just the square root of its dot product with itself,\n\\[||\\mathbf{v}|| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}.\\]\nWe can also talk about the distance between any two vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Denote the distance between these two vectors as \\(d(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w})\\). Since the difference vector is \\(\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w}\\), the distance between the two vectors is evidently just the length of the difference vector,\n\\[d(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = ||\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w}|| = \\sqrt{(\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w})} = \\sqrt{(v_x-w_x)^2 - (v_y-w_y)^2}.\\]\nFor example, the distance between the two vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}=(1, 0)\\) is\n\\[d(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}) = ||\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w}|| = \\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (1-0)^2} = 1.\\]\nIf a vector \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) has norm \\(||\\mathbf{e}||=1\\) it’s called a unit vector. We can convert any non-zero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) into a unit vector by dividing by its norm, which is called normalizing \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The unit vector gotten from normalizing \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) I’ll call \\(\\mathbf{e_v}\\). It’s given by\n\\[\\mathbf{e_v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{||\\mathbf{v}||}.\\]\nFor example, if \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1,1)\\), its norm is \\(||\\mathbf{v}||=\\sqrt{2}\\), so if we wanted to normalize it into a new unit vector \\(\\mathbf{e_v}\\), we’d have\n\\[\\mathbf{e_v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{||\\mathbf{v}||} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,1) \\approx (0.707, 0.707).\\]\nUnit vectors will always point in the same direction as the vector used to normalize them. The only difference is they’ll have length one. In the plane, unit vectors will always lie along the unit circle. Here’s a plot of this idea using the previous example.\n\nv = np.array([1, 2])\nev = v / np.sqrt(2)\nplot_vectors([v, ev], title='$\\mathbf{e}_v = ||\\mathbf{v}||^{-1} \\mathbf{v}$', ticks_every=0.5, zorders=[0, 1],\n             text_offsets=[[0.01, 0.05], [-0.2, 0.2]], colors=['steelblue', 'red'],\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$\\mathbf{e}_v$'], headwidth=6)"

    "text": "Linear Independence\nI just showed we can decompose any vector \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\) into its projections \\(\\mathbf{v} = v_x \\mathbf{e}_x + v_y \\mathbf{e}_y\\). The fact we can do this is because the unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_y\\) are special, for a few reasons.\nThe first reason these vectors are special is that they don’t lie along the same line in the plane. Said differently, we can’t write one vector as a scalar multiple of the other, \\(\\mathbf{e}_x \\neq c \\mathbf{e}_y\\) for any scalar \\(c\\). Vectors with this property are called linearly independent.\nMore generally, a set of \\(k\\) vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}\\) is called linearly independent if no one vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_j\\) in the set can be written as a linear combination of the rest, i.e. for any choice of scalars \\(c_i\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_j \\neq \\sum_{i \\neq j} c_i \\mathbf{v}_i.\\]\nA set of vectors that isn’t linearly independent is called linearly dependent. In a linearly dependent set, you can always express at least one vector as a linear combination of the rest, for example by finding a choice of scalars \\(c_i\\), you could write \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\) as\n\\[\\mathbf{v}_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} c_i \\mathbf{v}_i = c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_{k-1} \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}.\\]\nLinearly dependent sets of vectors are redundant in a sense. We have more than we need. We can always keep dropping vectors from the set until the ones remaining are linearly independent.\nThe vector space spanned by all linear combinations of a set of vectors is called the span of that set. The span of a single vector will always be a line, since a linear combination of any one vector is just the scalar multiples of that vector. The span of any two linearly independent vectors will always be a plane. The span of \\(k\\) linearly independent vectors will form a \\(k\\)-dimensional hyperplane.\nAs a simple example, consider the following set of vectors in the plane,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{v}_0 &= (1, 0), \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_1 &= (0, 1), \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_2 &= (1, 1).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIf you stare at these for a second, you’ll see that \\(\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{v}_0 + \\mathbf{v}_1\\), so this set can’t be linearly independent. The third vector is redundant. Any two vectors in this set span the exact same plane \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). In fact, you’ll never have more than 2 linearly independent vectors of size 2. Why?\n\nv0 = np.array([1, 0])\nv1 = np.array([0, 1])\nv2 = np.array([1, 1])\nplot_vectors(\n    [v2, v0, v1], colors=['salmon', 'steelblue', 'limegreen'], xlim=(-0.5, 1.5), ylim=(-0.5, 1.5),\n    ticks_every=0.5, zorders=[0, 1, 2, 3], headwidth=5, text_offsets=[[0.03, 0.05], [0.03,0.05], [0.03,0.05]],\n    title='$\\mathbf{v}_0$, $\\mathbf{v}_1$, $\\mathbf{v}_2=\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}_1$', \n    labels=['$\\mathbf{v}_2$', '$\\mathbf{v}_0$', '$\\mathbf{v}_1$'])\n\n\n\n\nFor vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), there are only two possibilities, they either lie on the same line, or they span the whole plane. This follows from the fact that any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be decomposed as \\(\\mathbf{v} = v_x \\mathbf{e}_x + v_y \\mathbf{e}_y\\). An implication of this fact is that a set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) can only be linearly independent if it contains only one or two vectors. If it contains a third vector, that vector must be a linear combination of the other two. The maximum number of linearly independent vectors in a set is the dimension of the vector space. Since \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is 2-dimensional, it can only sustain 2 linearly independent vectors at a time."

We can use vectors in this set as a “basis” to write any other vector.\nMore generally, a set of \\(k\\) vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{v}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}\\) form a basis for a vector space if the following two conditions hold, 1. The vectors are all linearly independent, 2. The vectors span the full vector space.\nAnother way of saying the same thing is that a basis is a set of exactly \\(n\\) linearly independent vectors, where \\(n\\) is the dimension of the vector space. A basis contains the minimal number of vectors needed to span the vector space.\nThe special vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_y\\) form a basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), since we can write any other vector as a linear combination of those two. Not only are these two vectors a basis, however. They satisfy two other useful properties, 1. They’re both unit vectors, \\(||\\mathbf{e}_x|| = ||\\mathbf{e}_y|| = 1\\). 2. They’re orthogonal to each other, that is, \\(\\mathbf{e}_x \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_y = 0\\).\nA basis satisfying these two properties is called an orthonormal basis. An orthonormal basis is special in that it allows us to pick out the components of a vector directly by just taking dot products with the basis vectors. It’s only true in an orthonormal basis that we can write the components of a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) as,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nv_x &= \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_x, \\\\\nv_y &= \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_y.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe set \\(\\{\\mathbf{e}_x, \\mathbf{e}_y\\}\\) is only one example of an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). It’s called the standard basis, since it’s the basis whose vectors point along the usual positive x and y axes.\nExpressing any vector in terms of its basis is just projecting the vector down onto each of the basis axes. Let’s do a quick example. Let \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1.25,2)\\) be a vector. Decomposed into the standard basis we just get\n\\[\\mathbf{v} = 1.25 \\mathbf{e}_x + 2 \\mathbf{e}_y.\\]\nGraphically this just looks as follows. We’ve already seen a plot like this, except this time I’m including the basis vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}_x\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_y\\) explicitly. Notice that the two basis vectors form a \\(90^\\circ\\) angle, i.e. they’re perpendicular. I’ll show in a moment that this is implied by the fact that \\(\\mathbf{e}_x \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_y = 0\\).\n\nv = np.array([1.25, 2])\nex = np.array([1, 0])\ney = np.array([0, 1])\nplot_vectors(\n    [v, v[0] * ex, v[1] * ey, ex, ey], colors=['red', 'steelblue', 'steelblue', 'black', 'black'], \n    ticks_every=1, zorders=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], headwidth=5,\n    text_offsets=[[0,0], [0,0.2], [0.05,0], [-0.2,0.2], [0.05,0]],\n    title='$\\mathbf{v}=v_x \\mathbf{e}_x + v_y \\mathbf{e}_y$', \n    labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$v_x \\mathbf{e}_x$', '$v_y \\mathbf{e}_y$', '$\\mathbf{e}_x$', '$\\mathbf{e}_y$'])\n\n\n\n\nOf course, I already said the standard basis isn’t the only orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) we could choose. Here’s an example of another one that would work equally well. Let \\(\\mathbf{e}_a=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1,1)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{e}_b=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (-1,1)\\). Notice that both vectors have unit length, and they’re orthogonal since \\(\\mathbf{e}_a \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_b = 0\\). Thus, they form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). In this basis, \\(\\mathbf{v}=(1.25, 2)\\) would be written\n\\[\\mathbf{v} = (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_a) \\mathbf{e}_a + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_b) \\mathbf{e}_b \\approx 2.298 \\mathbf{e}_a + 0.530 \\mathbf{e}_b.\\]\nThis is a very different representation for \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Nevertheless, the two basis vectors are still perpendicular to each other. You can see a plot of this below.\nThere are infinitely many orthonormal bases for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Just take any two perpendicular vectors in the plane and normalize them to unit length and they’ll form a valid orthonormal basis.\n\nv = np.array([1.25, 2])\nea = np.array([1, 1]) / np.sqrt(2)\neb = np.array([-1, 1]) / np.sqrt(2)\nvectors = [v, np.dot(v, ea) * ea, np.dot(v, eb) * eb, ea, eb]\nplot_vectors(\n    vectors, ticks_every=1, zorders=[0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2], headwidth=7,\n    colors=['red', 'steelblue', 'steelblue', 'black', 'black'],\n    text_offsets=[[0, 0], [0.03, 0], [-0.3, -0.65], [-0.1, -0.48], [-0.2, 0.15]],\n    title='$\\mathbf{v}=v_a \\mathbf{e}_a + v_b \\mathbf{e}_b$', \n    labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$v_a \\mathbf{e}_a$', '$v_b \\mathbf{e}_b$', '$\\mathbf{e}_a$', '$\\mathbf{e}_b$'])"

    "text": "Cosine Similarity\nJust like we can express the length of a vector using the dot product, it turns out we can also express the angle between any two vectors in the plane using the dot product. If \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between two vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\), it turns out the dot product is given by\n\\[\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = ||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{w}|| \\cos \\theta.\\]\nNote that both sides of this equation are scalars since the dot product is a scalar and the product of norms is a scalar. If you’re good at trigonometry, you can convince yourself this formula must be true by projecting \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) similar to the way we did projections onto the x and y axes before. The difference this time is that the component of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is not \\(v_x\\) or \\(v_y\\) anymore, but instead \\(||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cos \\theta\\).\nYou can see two special cases of this formula by looking at what happens when the two vectors are parallel or perpendicular. If the two vectors are parallel, then \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ, 180^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cos \\theta = \\pm 1\\), so \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\pm ||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{w}||\\). More importantly, if the two vectors are perpendicular, then \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ, 270^\\circ\\), so \\(\\cos \\theta = 0\\), so \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). That is, perpendicular vectors are orthogonal. They mean the same thing.\nIt’s more common to express this formula with \\(\\cos \\theta\\) on one side and the vector terms on the other so you can solve for the angle (or more commonly just the cosine of the angle). In this case, we have \\[\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{w}||}.\\]\nWhat matters more than anything is what this formula says and how to use it. Suppose, for example, you want to find the angle between the two vectors \\(\\mathbf{v} = (1,1)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w} = (0, -1)\\). Then you’d have\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} &= 1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1, \\\\\n||\\mathbf{v}|| &= \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}, \\\\\n||\\mathbf{w}|| &= \\sqrt{0^2 + (-1)^2} = 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nPlugging this into the cosine formula gives,\n\\[\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\theta = \\cos^{-1}\\bigg(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\bigg) = 135^\\circ.\n\\]\nYou can verify this is correct by plotting the two vectors and confirming that they’re about \\(135^\\circ\\) from each other, which corresponds to about 1.25 quarter turns around a circle. It’s interesting to note that the dot product will only be negative when the angle between the two vectors is obtuse, i.e. more than \\(90^\\circ\\), which is of course the case here.\n\nv = np.array([1, 1])\nw = np.array([0, -1])\nplot_vectors([v, w], title='$\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = ||\\mathbf{v}||||\\mathbf{w}|| \\cos \\\\theta$', \n             text_offsets=[[0, 0], [0.1, 0]], ticks_every=0.5, xlim=(-1, 2), ylim=(-1.5, 1.5),\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$\\mathbf{w}$'], colors=['red', 'steelblue'], headwidth=7)\n\n\n\n\nIn machine learning, this formula for \\(\\cos \\theta\\) is called the cosine similarity. The reason for this is that the dot product itself is a measure of how similar two vectors are. To see why, consider two special cases: - The two vectors are parallel: This is as large as the dot product between two vectors can get in absolute value. The vectors are as similar as they can be in a sense. Up to a scalar multiple, they contain the same information. - The two vectors are perpendicular: This is as small as the dot product between two vectors can get in absolute value. The two vectors are as different as they can be in a sense. They share pretty much no information. Information about one vector tells you basically nothing about the other.\nThe cosine similarity is a function of two input vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Since we don’t actually care about the angle \\(\\theta\\) usually, we’ll more often denote the cosine similarity using a notation like \\(\\cos(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w})\\) to make it clear it’s a function of its two input vectors,\n\\[\\cos(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{w}||}.\\]\nNote the cosine similarity is just a normalized dot product, since dividing by the norms forces \\(-1 \\leq \\cos(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}) \\leq 1\\). It thus captures the same idea of similarity that the dot product does, but it’s more useful when the lengths of vectors get out of control. This is particularly likely to happen in high dimensions, when \\(n >> 2\\). This is the so-called “curse of dimensionality”. We’ll come back to this idea in future lessons.\nHere’s a quick implementation of the cosine similarity function using numpy. There’s no built-in function to do it, but it’s easy enough to implement by making judicious use of the np.dot function. It should give the same answer found above for \\(\\cos \\theta\\), which is \\(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx -0.707\\).\n\ndef cosine_similarity(v, w):\n    return np.dot(v, w) / np.sqrt(np.dot(v, v) * np.dot(w, w))\n\nprint(f'cos(v, w) = {cosine_similarity(v, w)}')\n\ncos(v, w) = -0.7071067811865475\n\n\nAlgorithm Analysis: Like the dot product, this function uses only \\(O(n)\\) FLOPS. There are three independent dot product operations happening here, each adding \\(O(n)\\) FLOPS. Since the outputs of dot products are scalars, the multiply and divide only add one FLOP each. The square root isn’t obvious, but you can assume it takes some constant number of FLOPS as well. The total must therefore be \\(O(n)\\)."

It’s the most natural way to do so sense it corresponds to your intuitive notions of length, which itself relates to the Pythagorean Theorem. There are other ways to quantify vector length as well that aren’t as intuitive. Because they do sometimes show up in machine learning I’ll briefly mention a couple of these here.\nThe norm I’ve covered is called the 2-norm. It’s called this because it involves squares and square roots. We can write it in the form\n\\[||\\mathbf{v}|| = ||\\mathbf{v}||_2 = \\big(v_x^2 + v_y^2 \\big)^{1/2}.\\]\nIt turns out we can replace the twos with any other positive number \\(p>1\\) to get generalized norms, called p-norms,\n\\[||\\mathbf{v}||_p = \\big(v_x^p + v_y^p \\big)^{1/p}.\\]\nThe p-norms cover a large class of norms, since any \\(1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty\\) can define a valid norm. The 2-norm, as you’d guess, occurs when \\(p=2\\). A couple of other norms that show up in machine learning are the 1-norm when \\(p=1\\), and the infinity norm when \\(p=\\infty\\).

We have,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n||\\mathbf{v}||_1 &= |1| + |-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, \\\\\n||\\mathbf{v}||_2 &= \\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236, \\\\\n||\\mathbf{v}||_\\infty &= \\max\\big(|1|, |-2|\\big) = \\max(1, 2) = 2.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(||\\mathbf{v}||_1 \\geq ||\\mathbf{v}||_2 \\geq ||\\mathbf{v}||_\\infty\\). This is a general fact.\nIt’s a little hard right now to describe why these norms are useful in machine learning since we don’t currently have the context. Just know that these norms do come up sometimes. I’ll go into more depth on the uses of these different norms as we apply them. In practice though, we’ll probably work with the regular 2-norm maybe 90% of the time.\nIn numpy, you can calculate any \\(p\\)-norm using the function np.linalg.norm(v, ord=p). Here’s an example.\n\nv = np.array([1, -2])\nprint(f'1-Norm of v: {np.linalg.norm(v, ord=1)}')\nprint(f'2-Norm of v: {np.linalg.norm(v, ord=2)}')\nprint(f'Infinity-Norm of v: {np.linalg.norm(v, ord=np.inf)}')\n\n1-Norm of v: 3.0\n2-Norm of v: 2.23606797749979\nInfinity-Norm of v: 2.0"

A matrix space is just a vector space, except it has two dimensions \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). We’ll denote the matrix space of \\(m \\times n\\) matrices with the symbol \\(\\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\). Just like vector spaces, matrix spaces must be closed under linear combinations.

This means matrices behave the same way under addition and scalar multiplication as vectors do.\nWhile this fact should be kind of obvious by now, here’s an example anyway. I’ll choose \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) to both be \\(2 \\times 2\\) here.

The properties of \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde A}\\) aren’t important (it’s called the adjugate if you’re curious). But this general fact turns out to be true for any \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, except the formula for the determinant gets a lot more complicated. What’s important is that \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) is inversely proportional to the determinant. That’s why we can’t allow \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = 0\\), because then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\) blows up due to the division by zero.\nNow, I’ve already said \\((\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})^{-1} = \\mathbf{B}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\). If then\n\\[\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A})}\\mathbf{\\tilde A}, \\quad \\mathbf{B}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(\\mathbf{B})}\\mathbf{\\tilde B},\\]\nit’s evidently the case that\n\\[(\\mathbf{AB})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(\\mathbf{AB})}\\mathbf{\\tilde{AB}} = \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) \\cdot \\text{det}(\\mathbf{B})}\\mathbf{\\tilde B}\\mathbf{\\tilde A} = \\mathbf{B}^{-1} \\mathbf{A}^{-1}.\\]\nProvided that \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{AB}}=\\mathbf{\\tilde B}\\mathbf{\\tilde A}\\), which is true, it thus follows that\n\\[\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}) = \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) \\cdot \\text{det}(\\mathbf{B}) = \\text{det}(\\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}).\\]\nSaid differently, the determinant of a matrix product is just the product of their individual determinants.\nIn general, the determinant of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a nasty \\(n\\) degree multivariate polynomial of the elements of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). There’s no reliably easy way to calculate it except for small \\(n\\) matrices. In numpy, you can use np.linalg.det(A) to calculate the determinant, but just as with inverses, this is a numerically unstable operation, and so should be avoided where possible. Moreover, it runs in \\(O(n^3)\\) time, which is just as slow as matrix multiplication.\nHere’s an example. I’ll verify this “product rule” for determinants using two \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrices. The determinant of both matrices turns out to be \\(6\\), which means their product should have determinant \\(36\\).\n\nA = np.array(\n    [[3, 0, 0],\n     [1, 2, 0],\n     [1, 1, 1]])\nB = np.array(\n    [[1, 1, 1],\n     [0, 2, 1],\n     [0, 0, 3]])\ndet_A = np.linalg.det(A)\ndet_B = np.linalg.det(B)\ndet_AB = np.linalg.det(A @ B)\nprint(f'det(A) = {det_A}')\nprint(f'det(B) = {det_B}')\nprint(f'det(AB) = {det_AB}')\n\ndet(A) = 6.0\ndet(B) = 6.0\ndet(AB) = 36.0\n\n\nNotice in both cases the determinant happens to be the product of the diagonal elements\n\\[\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{det}(\\mathbf{B}) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6.\\]\nI rigged the result to come out this way. It’s not always true. It’s only true when a matrix is either lower triangular (the elements above the diagonal are all zero), upper triangular (the elements below the diagonal are all zero), or diagonal (the elements off the diagonal are all zero). In this example, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) was lower triangular and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) was upper triangular. I chose both to have the same diagonal elements (in different order) on purpose.\nMore generally, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is diagonal or upper/lower triangular, then\n\\[\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} A_{i,i} = A_{0,0} A_{1,1} \\cdots A_{n-1,n-1}.\\]\nIt’s not yet obvious, but we can always “change” a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) into one of these three kinds of matrices, and then calculate the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) this way. There are a few ways to do this. I’ll cover these when I get to matrix factorizations below.\nSome other properties of the determinant that you can verify are, - \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{I}) = 1\\). - \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}^\\top) = \\text{det}(\\mathbf{A})\\). - \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A})}\\). - \\(\\text{det}(c\\mathbf{A}) = c^n\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A})\\).\nThe determinant is one important way to get a scalar out of a matrix. Another useful scalar is the trace, which is far simpler to calculate. The trace of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the sum of its diagonal elements, usually written\n\\[\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} A_{i,i} = A_{0,0} + A_{1,1} + \\cdots + A_{n-1,n-1}.\\]\nUnlike the determinant, the trace doesn’t split up over products. It instead splits over addition,\n\\[\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) + \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{B}).\\]\nThis is very easy to verify from the fact that the sum is element-wise, so \\(\\sum (A+B)_{i,i} = \\sum A_{i,i} + \\sum B_{i,i}\\).\nSome other fairly trivial properties the trace satisfies are, - \\(\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) = n\\). - \\(\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}^\\top) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A})\\). - \\(\\text{tr}(c\\mathbf{A}) = c\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A})\\). - \\(\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{A})\\).\nHere’s a “proof” of the last result on the same \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrices above. In numpy, you can calculate the trace using np.trace. It’s not unstable like the determinant is, and it’s fast to calculate since it’s only summing the \\(n\\) diagonal terms, which is \\(O(n)\\) time.\n\ntr_AB = np.trace(A @ B)\ntr_BA = np.trace(B @ A)\nprint(f'tr(AB) = {tr_AB}')\nprint(f'tr(BA) = {tr_BA}')\n\ntr(AB) = 13\ntr(BA) = 13\n\n\nIt’s kind of obvious what the determinant is good for. It tells you how invertible a matrix is. But what does the trace tell you? It turns out both the trace and the determinant also tell you something important about the scale of the matrix. We’ll see this in more depth below when we talk about eigenvalues."

Roughly speaking, a matrix is invertible if we can’t write any one column vector as a function of the other column vectors. This is just the definition of linear independence.\nRecall a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_{k-1}\\) is linearly independent if no one vector is a linear combination of the rest,\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_j \\neq \\sum_{i \\neq j} c_i \\mathbf{x}_j.\\]\nIf one vector is a linear combination of the rest, they’re linearly dependent.\nAn \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is invertible if and only if its column vectors are all linearly independent. Equivalently, the column vectors span an \\(n\\)-dimensional vector space. To see why this is true, let’s look at a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) with column vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}=\\binom{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\binom{c}{d}\\),\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{a} & \\mathbf{b} \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nNow, if \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) are linearly dependent, then \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must be a scalar multiple of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), say \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\beta \\mathbf{a}\\).

For the \\(2 \\times 2\\) case, that means any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) hit by \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) will get mapped onto the same line, no matter what \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) you pick. The matrix is collapsing, or projecting, the vector space down to a lower-dimensional subspace.\nHere’s a plot of this idea. I’ll make \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) have two linearly dependent columns, then plot its action on several different vectors, plotted in black. Acting on these by \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) will map them to the red vectors, which all lie on the same line in the plane. They’re all collapsing onto the same subspace, evidently the line \\(y=-x\\).\n\nbeta = 1.5\na0 = np.array([1, -1]).reshape(-1, 1)\na1 = beta * a0\nA = np.hstack([a0, a1])\nv = np.array([1, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)\nw = np.array([-1, 0]).reshape(-1, 1)\nu = np.array([1, -3]).reshape(-1, 1)\nvectors = [x.flatten() for x in [v, A @ v, w, A @ w, u, A @ u]]\n\nplot_vectors(vectors, colors=['black', 'red'] * 3, title='Linearly Dependence',\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{v}$', '$\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}$'] + [''] * 4,\n             text_offsets=[[0, 0]] * 6, headwidth=5)\n\n\n\n\nThe number of linearly independent column vectors a matrix has is called its rank, written \\(\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A})\\). Clearly it’ll always be the case that \\(\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) \\leq n\\). When \\(\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = n\\) exactly the matrix is called full rank. Only full rank square matrices are invertible.\nHere’s an example. I’ll use np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) to calculate the rank of the above \\(2 \\times 2\\) example. Since \\(\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{A})=1<2\\), the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) must be singular, as I’ve of course already shown.\n\nrank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)\nprint(f'rank(A) = {rank}')\n\nrank(A) = 1"

If \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are size \\(n\\) vectors, define their outer product by\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{y}^\\top =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_0 y_0 & x_0 y_1 & \\cdots & x_0 y_{n-1} \\\\\nx_1 y_0 & x_1 y_1 & \\cdots & x_1 y_{n-1} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_{n-1} y_0 & x_{n-1} y_1 & \\cdots & x_{n-1} y_{n-1} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nEach column vector \\(\\mathbf{a}_j\\) of the outer product matrix is linearly proportional to the first column \\(\\mathbf{a}_0\\), since\n\\[\\mathbf{a}_j = \\mathbf{x} y_j = \\mathbf{x} y_0 \\frac{y_j}{y_0} = \\frac{y_j}{y_0} \\mathbf{a}_0.\\]\nThis means that only one column vector is linearly independent, which implies \\(\\text{rank}(\\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{y}^\\top)=1\\). The outer product is evidently rank-1, and hence highly singular. You’d never be able to invert it. But it is useful as we’ll see soon.\nHere’s an example of an outer product calculation. You can either calculate x @ y.T directly or use np.outer(x, y). Since both vectors are size \\(3\\), the outer product should be a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix with rank-1.\n\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3])\ny = np.array([3, 2, 1])\nouter = np.outer(x, y)\nprint(f'xy^T = \\n{outer}')\nprint(f'rank(xy^T) = {np.linalg.matrix_rank(outer)}')\n\nxy^T = \n[[3 2 1]\n [6 4 2]\n [9 6 3]]\nrank(xy^T) = 1\n\n\nYou can think of the outer product matrix as a kind of projection matrix. It always projects vectors onto the same one-dimensional line in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Why? Suppose \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is some vector. If we hit it with the outer product matrix \\(\\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{y}^\\top\\), using the fact matrix multiplication is associative, we get\n\\[(\\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{y}^\\top) \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{x} (\\mathbf{y}^\\top \\mathbf{v}) = (\\mathbf{y} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{x}.\\]\nThat is, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) just gets projected onto the space spanned by the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Evidently the other outer product vector \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) determines how long the projection vector will be. Here’s a visual representation of this idea for 2-dimensional vectors. Take\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x} &= (1, 1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{y} &= (1, -1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_0 &= (-1, 2) \\quad &\\Longrightarrow \\quad (\\mathbf{y} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_0) \\mathbf{x} &= (-3, -3) \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_1 &= (2, 0) \\quad &\\Longrightarrow \\quad (\\mathbf{y} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1) \\mathbf{x} &= (2, 2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_2 &= (2, -1) \\quad &\\Longrightarrow \\quad (\\mathbf{y} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2) \\mathbf{x} &= (3, 3). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nApplying the outer product \\(\\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{y}^\\top\\) to each \\(\\mathbf{v}_i\\) should project each vector onto the space spanned by \\(\\mathbf{x}=(1, 1)\\), which is just the line \\(y=x\\). Notice the projections are all proportional to \\((1, 1)\\), as they should be. In the plot below, each vector and its projection have the same color.

In this notation, we’d use the short-hand\n\\[\\mathbf{D} = \\text{diag}(1,2,3).\\]\nto refer to the matrix in the above example.

This is because multiplying diagonal matrix with a vector is equivalent to element-wise multiplying the diagonal elements with the vector, which causes each vector component to get stretched by some amount. For example, if \\(\\mathbf{x}=(1,1,1)\\), when the above example \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) acts on it, we’d get\n\\[\n\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{x} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\circ\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nHere’s an example of how to define a diagonal matrix in numpy using np.diag.

    "text": "Orthogonal Matrices\nThe last class of matrices I’ll introduce are more subtle, but very important geometrically. These are the orthogonal matrices. An orthogonal matrix is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) whose transpose is its inverse, i.e.\n\\[\\mathbf{Q}^\\top = \\mathbf{Q}^{-1} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{I}.\\]\nAs an example, consider the following matrix,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Q} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can check \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is orthogonal by checking it satisfies the condition \\(\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{I}\\),\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{I}.\n\\]\nNotice from this example that the column vectors \\(\\mathbf{q}_0, \\mathbf{q}_1\\) form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), since\n\\[\\mathbf{q}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{q}_1 = 0, \\quad \\mathbf{q}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{q}_0 = \\mathbf{q}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{q}_1 = 1.\\]\nThis is a general fact. The column vectors of an orthogonal matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) form a complete set of orthonormal basis vectors for \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Conversely, we can always form an orthogonal matrix by first finding an orthonormal basis and then creating column vectors out of the basis vectors. This is usually the way orthogonal matrices are constructed in practice using algorithms like the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm.\nIt’s not at all obvious, but the fact that the column vectors of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) form an orthonormal basis constrains the number of unique elements \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is allowed to have. Requiring each \\(\\mathbf{q}_i\\) means \\(n\\) total elements are already determined. The further requirement that the column vectors be mutually orthogonal determines another \\(\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)\\). This means \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) only has \\(n^2 - n - \\frac{1}{2}n(n-1) = \\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)\\) unique elements. For example, when \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is \\(2 \\times 2\\) it only has \\(\\frac{1}{2}2(2-1)=1\\) unique element. The other \\(3\\) are all determined by that one element. This unique element can be thought of as a rotation angle. I’ll come back to this in a minute.\nAn important fact about orthogonal matrices is that they preserve the dot products between vectors. If \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are two vectors, then\n\\[(\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{x}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{y}) = \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}.\\]\nThis follows from the fact that \\((\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{x})^\\top (\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{y}) = \\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}^\\top\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{I} \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\\). Since the dot product encodes the notions of length and angle, this fact implies that orthogonal matrices can’t change the lengths of vectors, nor the angles between vectors. Orthogonal matrices preserve the geometry of the vector space.\nThis fact suggests some deep intuition about what orthogonal matrices do. If they can’t change the lengths of vectors or the angles between them, then all they can do is rotate vectors or reflect them across some line. In fact, it turns out any \\(2 \\times 2\\) orthogonal matrix can be written in the form\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Q} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & \\mp \\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\pm \\cos \\theta \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is some angle (expressed in radians). When the right column vector is \\(\\binom{-\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is a pure rotation matrix. It will rotate any vector in the plane by an angle \\(\\theta\\), counterclockwise if \\(\\theta > 0\\), and clockwise if \\(\\theta < 0\\). When the right column vector is \\(\\binom{\\sin\\theta}{-\\cos\\theta}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) becomes a reflection matrix; it’ll reflect vectors about the line at an angle \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) with the x-axis. The combination of these two together can generate any 2D rotation or reflection.\nHere’s a visual of this idea. I’ll take the unit vector \\(\\mathbf{e}_x=(1,0)\\) and use \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) to rotate it by some angle, in this case \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\). Note the need to convert the angle to radians by multiplying the angle in degrees by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\). You should be able to confirm that the red vector is indeed the black vector \\(\\mathbf{e}_x\\) rotated counterclockwise by \\(45^\\circ\\) to the new vector \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{e}_x = 2^{-1/2}(1,1)\\). The factor of \\(2^{-1/2}\\) appears to keep the vector normalized to unit length.\n\ntheta_degrees = 45\ntheta = theta_degrees * np.pi / 180\nQ = np.array([\n    [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)], \n    [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]])\nex = np.array([1, 0]).reshape(-1, 1)\nQex = Q @ ex\nplot_vectors([ex.flatten(), Qex.flatten()], colors=['black', 'red'], title=f'${theta_degrees}^\\circ$ Rotation',\n             labels=['$\\mathbf{e}_x$', '$\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{e}_x$'], text_offsets=[[-0.1, 0.1], [0, 0]],\n             ticks_every=1, xlim=(-0.5, 1.5), ylim=(-0.5, 1.5))\n\n\n\n\nI’ll finish this section by noting that orthogonal matrices always have determinant \\(\\pm 1\\).

If \\(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), we can do an LU factorization of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and write the system as \\(\\mathbf{LUx} = \\mathbf{b}\\). This can then be solved by breaking it into two steps, known as forward substitution and back substitution, - Forward substitution: Solve \\(\\mathbf{Ly} = \\mathbf{b}\\) for \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). - Back Substitution: Solve \\(\\mathbf{Ux} = \\mathbf{y}\\) for \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nThese two steps are easy to do since each system can be solved by substitution, working from the “tip” of the triangle down. The LU factorization is essentially what matrix solvers like np.linalg.solve do to solve linear systems.\nOf course, the question still remains how to actually factor \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) into \\(\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{U}\\). I won’t describe the algorithm to do this, or any matrix factorization really, since their inner workings aren’t that relevant to machine learning. If you’re curious, LU factorization is done using some variant of an algorithm known as Gaussian Elimination. Note the LU factorization in general is a cubic time algorithm, i.e. \\(O(n^3)\\) if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(n \\times n\\).\nThe LU factorization can also be used to compute the determinant of a square matrix.

This system can be solved by using the same technique of forward substitution plus back substitution. Note that solving for both the determinant and inverse this way each takes \\(O(n^3)\\) time due to the LU decomposition. This is one reason why you should probably avoid calculating these quantities explicitly unless you really need them.\nStrangely, numpy doesn’t have a built-in LU factorization solver, but scipy does using scipy.linalg.lu. It factors a matrix into not two, but three products, \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{PLU}\\). The \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is a permutation matrix.

Taking the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\) and insisting it must be singular gives a polynomial equation, called the characteristic equation, that can (in principle) be solved for the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\),\n\\[\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0.\\]\nFor example, if \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is a symmetric \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix, we have\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nb & d \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na-\\lambda & b \\\\\nb & d-\\lambda \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = (a - \\lambda)(d - \\lambda) - b^2 = \\lambda^2 - (a + d)\\lambda + (ad-b^2) = 0.\n\\]\nNotice that \\(\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{S}) = a + d\\) and \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S}) = ad-b^2\\), so the characteristic equation in this special \\(2 \\times 2\\) cases reduces to\n\\[\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{S})\\lambda + \\text{det}(\\mathbf{S}) = 0.\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation whose solution is the two eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1\\). Once the eigenvalues are known, they can be plugged back into the linear equation \\((\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\\) to solve for the eigenvectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_0, \\mathbf{x}_1\\), e.g. using LU factorization.\nJust to put some numbers in, take the following specific \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{S})=2+2=4\\) and \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S})=2 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1 = 3\\), the characteristic equation is\n\\[\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad (\\lambda-1)(\\lambda - 3) = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\lambda=1, 3.\\]\nThe eigenvalues for this matrix are thus \\(\\lambda_0 = 3\\) and \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\). Note it’s conventional to order the eigenvalues from largest to smallest, though it isn’t required. The eigenvectors are gotten by solving the two systems\n\\[\n(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda_0 \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2-3 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2-3 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_0 \\\\\ny_0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\mathbf{x}_0 =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\approx\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.707 \\\\\n0.707 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\\[\n(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda_1 \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2-1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2-1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\ny_1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\n\\mathbf{x}_1 =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\approx\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.707 \\\\\n-0.707 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nYou can easily check that \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\) are orthogonal. Note the eigenvectors here have been normalized so \\(||\\mathbf{x}_0||=||\\mathbf{x}_1||=1\\). This isn’t required, but it’s the most common convention to ensure the eigenvector matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a properly orthogonal.\nHere’s a plot of what this looks like. I’ll show that \\(\\mathbf{v}_0=\\sqrt{2}\\mathbf{x}_0=(1,1)\\) gets scaled by a factor of \\(\\lambda_0=3\\) when acted on by \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). Similarly, I’ll show that \\(\\mathbf{v}_1=\\sqrt{2}\\mathbf{x}_1=(1,-1)\\) gets scaled by a factor of \\(\\lambda_1=1\\) (i.e. not at all) when acted on by \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). Importantly, notice that \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) doesn’t rotate either vector. They stay along their characteristic lines, or eigenspaces, which in this example are the lines \\(y=\\pm x\\).\n\nS = np.array([\n    [2, 1], \n    [1, 2]])\nv0 = np.array([1, 1]).reshape(-1, 1)\nSv0 = S @ v0\nv1 = np.array([1, -1]).reshape(-1, 1)\nSv1 = S @ v1\nvectors = [x.flatten() for x in [v0, Sv0, v1, Sv1]]\nplot_vectors(\n    vectors, colors=['black', 'red', 'black', 'blue'], xlim=(-1, 4), ylim=(-2, 4), zorders=[1, 0, 2, 3], \n    labels=['$\\mathbf{v}_0$', '$\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{v}_0$', '$\\mathbf{v}_1$', '$\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{v}_1$'],\n    text_offsets=[[-0.45, 0.25], [0.05, 0.15], [0.1, -0.5], [0.05, 0.3]], \n    title='Eigenspaces of $\\mathbf{S}$')\n\n\n\n\nA result I won’t prove, called the spectral theorem, guarantees that the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix will be real-valued, and that the eigenvectors will form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). This is why \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) ends up being an orthogonal matrix. The fact that the eigenvalues have to be real is why we can think of symmetric matrices as the matrix generalization of a real number.\nThe spectral decomposition \\(\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{X \\Lambda X}^\\top\\) is just a matrix way of writing the individual equations \\(\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{x} = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}\\). Grouping the eigenvectors and eigenvalues into matrices, we can write these equations in one go as \\(\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{X}\\), which is just the spectral decomposition.\nBack to our working example, putting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors into their respective matrices gives\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\Lambda} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad\n\\mathbf{X} =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThat is, the symmetric matrix \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) factorizes into the spectral decomposition\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{X \\Lambda X}^\\top =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can find the spectral decomposition of a symmetric matrix in numpy using np.linalg.eigh(S). Note that np.linalg.eig(S) will also work, but eigh is more efficient for symmetric matrices than eig. In either case, they return a pair of arrays, the first being the diagonals of \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\), the second being \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). I’ll also verify that the spectral decomposition indeed gives \\(\\mathbf{S}\\).\n\nS = np.array([[2, 1], \n              [1, 2]])\nlambdas, X = np.linalg.eigh(S)\nLambda = np.diag(lambdas)\nprint(f'Lambda = \\n{Lambda}')\nprint(f'X = \\n{X}')\nprint(f'X Lambda X^T = \\n{X @ Lambda @ X.T}')\n\nLambda = \n[[1. 0.]\n [0. 3.]]\nX = \n[[-0.70710678  0.70710678]\n [ 0.70710678  0.70710678]]\nX Lambda X^T = \n[[2. 1.]\n [1. 2.]]\n\n\nNotice something from the example I just worked. It turns out that \\(\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{S}) = 4 = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S}) = 3 = \\lambda_0 \\lambda_1\\). This fact turns out to always be true for \\(n \\times n\\) symmetric matrices, namely if \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) has eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\cdots, \\lambda_{n-1}\\), then\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{S}) &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\lambda_i = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_1 + \\cdots + \\lambda_{n-1}, \\\\\n\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S}) &= \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \\lambda_i = \\lambda_0 \\cdot \\lambda_1 \\cdots \\lambda_{n-1}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis fact implies that \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) will be invertible if and only if all the eigenvalues are non-zero, since otherwise we’d have \\(\\text{det}(\\mathbf{S})=0\\).\nGiven how important the spectral decomposition is to many applications, there are a lot of different algorithms for finding it, each with its own trade-offs. One popular algorithm for doing so is the QR algorithm. Roughly speaking, the QR algorithm works as follows: - Start with \\(\\mathbf{S}_0 = \\mathbf{S}\\). - For some number of iterations \\(t=0,1,\\cdots, T-1\\) do the following: - Calculate the QR factorization of \\(\\mathbf{S}_t\\): \\(\\mathbf{Q}_{t+1}, \\mathbf{R}_{t+1} = \\text{qr}(\\mathbf{S}_t)\\). - Update \\(\\mathbf{S}_t\\) by reversing the factorization order: \\(\\mathbf{S}_{t+1} = \\mathbf{R}_{t+1} \\mathbf{Q}_{t+1}\\). - Take \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\approx \\mathbf{S}_{T-1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X} \\approx \\mathbf{Q}_{T-1}\\).\nDue to the QR factorizations and matrix multiplications, this algorithm will be \\(O(n^3)\\) at each step, which all together gives a time complexity of \\(O(Tn^3)\\). It’s not at all obvious from what I’ve said why the QR algorithm even works. In fact, to work well it requires a few small modifications I won’t go into."

    "text": "Positive Definiteness\nThe eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) are important because they in some sense specify how much \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) tends to stretch vectors in different directions. Most important for machine learning purposes though is the sign of the eigenvalues. The sign of the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix essentially determine how hard it is to optimize a given function. This is especially relevant in machine learning, since training a model is all about optimizing the loss function of a model’s predictions against the data.\nIf \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is \\(n \\times n\\), it will have \\(n\\) eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\cdots, \\lambda_{n-1}\\). Ignoring the fact that each eigenvalue can be zero, each one will be either positive or negative. That means the sequence of eigenvalues can have \\(2^n\\) possible arrangements of signs. For example, when \\(n=3\\), we could have any of the \\(2^3=8\\) possible sign arrangements for the eigenvalues \\((\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)\\),\n\\[(+, +, +), \\ (+, +, -), \\ (+, -, +), \\ (-, +, +), \\ (+, -, -), \\ (-, +, -), \\ (-, -, +), \\ (-, -, -).\\]\nMost of these arrangements will have mixed signs, but there will always be exactly two arrangements that don’t, namely when the eigenvalues are all positive, and when the eigenvalues are all negative. These cases turn out to be special, as we’ll see.\nA symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive is called positive definite. A positive definite matrix is essentially the matrix equivalent of a positive real number. For this reason, we’ll write \\(\\mathbf{S} \\succ 0\\) to make the analogy of a scalar \\(s > 0\\) being positive. Positive definite matrices loosely speaking correspond to what are called convex functions, or “upward bowl shaped” functions.\nSimilarly, a symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all negative is called negative definite. A negative definite matrix is essentially the matrix equivalent of a negative real number. For this reason, we’ll write \\(\\mathbf{S} \\prec 0\\) to make the analogy of a scalar \\(s < 0\\) being negative. Negative definite matrices loosely speaking correspond to what are called concave functions, or “downward bowl shaped” functions.\nIf we now allow some of the eigenvalues to also be zero, we get the matrix equivalent of a non-negative and non-positive number, respectively. If the eigenvalues are all non-negative, the matrix is called positive semi-definite, written \\(\\mathbf{S} \\succcurlyeq 0\\). If the eigenvalues are all non-positive, it’s called negative semi-definite, written \\(\\mathbf{S} \\preccurlyeq 0\\).\nBy taking the spectral decomposition of \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) and expanding everything out, it’s possible to show that the following facts hold for any non-zero vector \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\), - Positive definite: If \\(\\mathbf{S} \\succ 0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{x} > 0\\). - Negative definite: If \\(\\mathbf{S} \\prec 0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{x} < 0\\). - Positive semi-definite: If \\(\\mathbf{S} \\succcurlyeq 0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0\\). - Negative semi-definite: If \\(\\mathbf{S} \\preccurlyeq 0\\), then \\(\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{x} \\leq 0\\).\nExpressions of the form \\(\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{x}\\) are called quadratic forms. They’ll always be scalars, since all they’re doing is taking the dot product \\(\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{x}\\). This is why these types of matrices are the matrix generalization of positive or negative numbers. If these dot products are positive for any vector, that’s about as good as we can do to say that the matrix itself is positive. Etc.\nAs you’d probably guess, the easiest way to determine if a symmetric matrix is any of these types of definite is to just calculate the eigenvalues and check their signs. For example, I showed before that the matrix\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nhas eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_0 = 3\\) and \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\). Since both of these are positive, \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is positive definite. It’s also positive semi-definite since they’re both non-negative. To check if a matrix is positive definite, for example, in numpy, you can do something like the following. Modify the inequality accordingly for the other types.\n\ndef is_positive_definite(S):\n    eigvals = np.linalg.eigvals(S)\n    return np.all(eigvals > 0)\n\nS = np.array([[2, 1], \n              [1, 2]])\nis_positive_definite(S)\n\nTrue"

    "section": "Singular Value Decomposition",
    "text": "Singular Value Decomposition\nThe spectral decomposition is mostly useful for square symmetric matrices. Yet, the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors seem to be incredibly useful for understanding how a matrix behaves. They say something useful about the characteristic scales and directions of a matrix and its underlying linear operator. It turns out we can generalize the spectral decomposition to arbitrary matrices, but with some slight modifications. This modified factorization is called the singular value decomposition, or SVD for short.\nSuppose \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is some arbitrary \\(m \\times n\\) matrix. It turns out we can always factor \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) into a product of the form\n\\[\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{V}^\\top,\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) orthogonal matrix called the left singular matrix, \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is a different \\(n \\times n\\) orthogonal matrix called the left singular matrix, and \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) is an \\(m \\times n\\) diagonal matrix called the singular value matrix.\nThe singular value matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) is a rectangular diagonal matrix. This means the diagonal will only have \\(k=\\min(m, n)\\) entries. The diagonal entries are called the singular values of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), usually denoted \\(\\sigma_0, \\sigma_1, \\cdots, \\sigma_{k-1}\\). Unlike eigenvalues, singular values are required to be non-negative.\nThe column vectors of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) are called the left and right singular vectors respectively. Since both matrices are orthogonal, their singular vectors will form an orthonormal basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) respectively.\nNotice that whereas with the spectral composition \\(\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{X}^\\top\\) has only a single orthogonal matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the SVD has two different orthogonal matrices \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) to worry about, and each one is a different size. Also, while \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\) can contain eigenvalues of any sign, \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) can only contain singular values that are nonnegative.\nNonetheless, the two factorizations are related by the following fact: The singular values of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) are the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix \\(\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{A}^\\top \\mathbf{A}\\). Not only that, they’re also the eigenvalues of the transposed symmetric matrix \\(\\mathbf{S}^\\top = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A}^\\top\\). This fact gives one way you could actually calculate the SVD. The singular value matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) will just be the eigenvalue matrix of \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) (and \\(\\mathbf{S}^\\top\\)). The left singular matrix \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) will be the eigenvector matrix of \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). The right singular matrix \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) will be the eigenvector matrix of \\(\\mathbf{S}^\\top\\). Very roughly speaking, this is what many SVD algorithms use, e.g. by applying the QR algorithm on both \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}^\\top\\).\nCalculating the SVD by hand is much more of a pain than the spectral decomposition is because you have to do it twice, once on \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) and once on \\(\\mathbf{S}^\\top\\). I’ll spare you the agony of this calculation, and just use numpy to calculate the SVD of the following matrix,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can use np.linalg.svd(A) to calculate the SVD of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). It’ll return a triplet of arrays, in order \\(\\mathbf{U}\\), the diagonal of \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{V}^T\\). Note to get the full \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) you can’t just use np.diag since \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) won’t be square here. You have to add a row of zeros after to make the calculation work out. I’ll do this just using a loop and filling in the diagonals manually.\nNotice that the two singular values are positive, \\(\\sigma_0 = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\\) and \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\). In this example, the right singular matrix \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is just \\(\\text{diag}(-1, 1)\\), which is clearly orthogonal. The left singular matrix \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) is a little harder to see, but it’s also orthogonal. Finally, the product \\(\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V}^\\top\\) indeed gives \\(\\mathbf{A}\\).\n\nA = np.array([\n    [1, 1],\n    [1, 0],\n    [1, -1]])\nm, n = A.shape\nk = min(m, n)\nU, sigma, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A)\nSigma = np.zeros((m, n))\nfor i in range(k):\n    Sigma[i, i] = sigma[i]\nUSVt = U @ Sigma @ Vt\nprint(f'U = \\n{U.round(10)}')\nprint(f'Sigma = \\n{Sigma.round(10)}')\nprint(f'V = \\n{Vt.T.round(10)}')\nprint(f'U Sigma V^T = \\n{USVt.round(10)}')\n\nU = \n[[-0.57735027  0.70710678  0.40824829]\n [-0.57735027  0.         -0.81649658]\n [-0.57735027 -0.70710678  0.40824829]]\nSigma = \n[[1.73205081 0.        ]\n [0.         1.41421356]\n [0.         0.        ]]\nV = \n[[-1.  0.]\n [-0.  1.]]\nU Sigma V^T = \n[[ 1.  1.]\n [ 1.  0.]\n [ 1. -1.]]\n\n\nTo give you an intuition is to what the SVD is doing, suppose \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is some size-\\(n\\) vector. Suppose we want to operate on \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) with \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) to get a new vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\). Writing \\(\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{V}^\\top\\), we can do this operation in a sequence of three successive steps: 1. Calculate \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{V}^\\top \\mathbf{x}\\): The output is also a size-\\(n\\) vector \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Since \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is orthogonal, this action can only rotate (or reflect) \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) by some angle in space. 2. Calculate \\(\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{y}\\): The output is now a size-\\(k\\) vector \\(\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k\\). Since \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\) is diagonal, it can only stretch \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) along the singular directions of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), not rotate it. 3. Calculate \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{z}\\): The output is now a size-\\(m\\) vector \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\). Since \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) is orthogonal, this action can only rotate (or reflect) \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) by some angle in space.\nThe final output is thus a vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\) that first got rotated in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), then scaled in \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\), then rotated again in \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\). So you can visualize this better let’s take a specific example. To make everything show up on one plot I’ll choose a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix, so \\(m=n=k=2\\), for example\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe singular values to this matrix turn out to be \\(\\sigma_0 \\approx 2.618\\) and \\(\\sigma_1 \\approx 0.382\\). What I’m going to do is randomly sample a bunch of unit vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), then apply the successive operations above to each vector. The original vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) are shown in red, the vectors \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{V}^\\top \\mathbf{x}\\) in blue, the vectors \\(\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{y}\\) in green, and finally the vectors \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{z}\\) in black. Notice that the red vectors just kind of fill in the unit circle, since they’re all unit vectors of length one. The blue vectors also fill in the unit circle, since \\(\\mathbf{V}^\\top\\) can only rotate vectors, not stretch them. The green vectors then get stretched out into an elliptical shape due to \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\). The distortion of the ellipse depends on the “distortion ratio” \\(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma_1} \\approx 6.85\\). This means one axis gets stretched about \\(6.85\\) times as much as the other. Finally, since \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) can only rotate vectors, the black vectors then rotate these stretched vectors into their final position.\n\nA = np.array([\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 1]])\nm, n = A.shape\nk = min(m, n)\nU, sigma, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A)\nSigma = np.diag(sigma)\nprint(f'Sigma = \\n{Sigma.round(10)}')\n\nSigma = \n[[2.61803399 0.        ]\n [0.         0.38196601]]\n\n\n\nplot_svd(A)\n\n\n\n\nThe “distortion ratio” \\(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma_1}\\) mentioned above can actually be used as a measure of how invertible a matrix is. It’s called the condition number, denoted \\(\\kappa\\). For a general \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, the condition number is defined as the ratio of the largest to the smallest singular value,\n\\[\\kappa = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma_{k-1}}.\\]\nThe higher the condition number is, the harder it is to invert \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). A condition number of \\(\\kappa=1\\) is when the singular values are the same. These are easiest to invert. Matrices with low \\(\\kappa\\) are called called well-conditioned matrices. The identity matrix has \\(\\kappa=1\\), for example. If one of the singular values is \\(0\\) then \\(\\kappa\\) will be infinite, meaning the matrix isn’t invertible at all. Matrices with high \\(\\kappa\\) are called ill-conditioned matrices. For this reason, the condition number is very often used in calculations when it’s important to make sure that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) isn’t singular or close to singular. In numpy, you can calculate the condition number of a matrix directly by using np.linalg.cond(A)."

Then writing out the SVD in terms of the column vectors, and multiplying everything out matrix multiplication style, we have\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{V}^\\top =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{u}_0 & \\mathbf{u}_1 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{u}_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\text{diag}\\big(\\sigma_0, \\sigma_1, \\cdots, \\sigma_{k-1}\\big)\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathbf{v}_0^\\top \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_1^\\top \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_{n-1}^\\top\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\sigma_i \\mathbf{u}_i \\mathbf{v}_i^\\top =\n\\sigma_0 \\mathbf{u}_0 \\mathbf{v}_0^\\top + \\sigma_1 \\mathbf{u}_1 \\mathbf{v}_1^\\top + \\cdots + \\sigma_{k-1} \\mathbf{u}_{k-1} \\mathbf{v}_{k-1}^\\top.\n\\]\nThat is, we can write \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) as a sum of outer products over the singular vectors, each weighted by its singular value. That’s fine. But why is it useful? All I did was re-write the SVD in a different form, after all. The gist of it is that we can use this formula to approximate \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by a lower-dimensional matrix. Supposing we only kept the first \\(d < k\\) terms of the right-hand side and dropped the rest, we’d have\n\\[\\mathbf{A} \\approx \\mathbf{U}_d \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_d \\mathbf{V}_d^\\top = \\sigma_0 \\mathbf{u}_0 \\mathbf{v}_0^\\top + \\sigma_1 \\mathbf{u}_1 \\mathbf{v}_1^\\top + \\cdots + \\sigma_{d-1} \\mathbf{u}_{d-1} \\mathbf{v}_{d-1}^\\top.\\]\nThis approximation will be a rank-\\(d\\) matrix again of size \\(m \\times n\\). It’s rank \\(d\\) because it’s a sum of \\(d\\) “independent” rank-1 matrices. When \\(d<<k\\), this is called the low-rank approximation. While this approximation is low rank it still has size \\(m \\times n\\). It’s the inner dimensions that got cut from \\(k\\) to \\(d\\), not the outer dimensions. To get a true low-dimensional approximation, we need to multiply both sides by \\(\\mathbf{V}_d\\),\n\\[\\mathbf{A}_d =  \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{V}_d = \\mathbf{U}_d \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_d.\\]\nWe’re now approximating the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) with an \\(m \\times d\\) matrix I’ll call \\(\\mathbf{A}_d\\). Said differently, we’re compressing the \\(n\\) columns of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) down to just \\(d<<n\\) columns. Note that we’re not dropping the last \\(n-d\\) columns, we’re building new columns that best approximate all of the old columns.\nLet’s try to understand why low rank approximations are useful, and that they indeed do give good approximations to large matrices. To do so, consider the following example. I’m going to load some data from a well-known dataset in machine learning called MNIST. It’s a dataset of images of handwritten digits. When the low-rank approximation is applied to data, it’s called principle components analysis, or PCA. PCA is probably the most fundamental dimension reduction algorithm, a way of compressing high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional data.\nEach image is size \\(28 \\times 28\\), which flatten out into \\(n = 28 \\cdot 28 = 784\\) dimensions. I’ll load \\(m=1000\\) random samples from the MNIST dataset. This will create a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of shape \\(1000 \\times 784\\). I’ll go ahead and calculate the SVD to get \\(\\mathbf{U}\\), \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{V}^\\top\\). In this case, \\(k=\\min(m,n)=784\\), so these matrices will have sizes \\(1000 \\times 1000\\), \\(1000 \\times 784\\), and \\(784 \\times 784\\) respectively. As I mentioned before, numpy only returns the non-zero diagonals of \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\), which is a size \\(k=784\\) vector of the singular values. Thankfully, that’s all we’ll need here.\n\nm = 1000\nA = sample_mnist(size=m)\nU, sigma, Vt = np.linalg.svd(A)\nA.shape, U.shape, sigma.shape, Vt.shape\nprint(f'A.shape = {A.shape}')\nprint(f'U.shape = {U.shape}')\nprint(f'sigma.shape = {sigma.shape}')\nprint(f'Vt.shape = {Vt.shape}')\n\nA.shape = (1000, 784)\nU.shape = (1000, 1000)\nsigma.shape = (784,)\nVt.shape = (784, 784)\n\n\nThink of each row of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) as representing a single image in the dataset, and each column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) as representing a single pixel of the image.\nSince these are images, I might as well show you what they look like. To do that, just pick a random row from the matrix. Each row will be a flattened image. To turn it into an image, we can just reshape the row to have shape \\(28 \\times 28\\), then plot it using plt.imshow. Below, I’m picking off the first row, which turns out to be an image of a handwritten \\(0\\).\n\nimg = A[0, :].reshape(28, 28)\nplt.imshow(img, cmap='Greys')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start by taking \\(d=2\\). Why? Because when \\(d=2\\) we can plot each image as a point in the xy-plane! This suggests a powerful application of the low-rank approximation, to visualize high-dimensional data. To calculate \\(\\mathbf{A}_d\\), we’ll need to truncate \\(\\mathbf{U}\\), \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{V}^\\top\\). To make the shapes come out right, we’ll want to drop the first \\(d\\) columns of \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) and the first \\(d\\) rows of \\(\\mathbf{V}^\\top\\). Once we’ve got these, we can calculate \\(\\mathbf{A}_d\\), which in this case will be size \\(1000 \\times 2\\).\n\nd = 2\nU_d, sigma_d, Vt_d = U[:, :d], sigma[:d], Vt[:d, :]\nA_d = A @ Vt_d.T\nprint(f'U_d.shape = {U_d.shape}')\nprint(f'sigma_d = {sigma_d}')\nprint(f'Vt_d.shape = {Vt_d.shape}')\nprint(f'A_d.shape = {A_d.shape}')\n\nU_d.shape = (1000, 2)\nsigma_d = [197.89062659  66.60026657]\nVt_d.shape = (2, 784)\nA_d.shape = (1000, 2)\n\n\nNow we have \\(m=1000\\) “images”, each with \\(d=2\\) “variables”. This means we can plot them in the xy-plane, taking \\(x\\) to be the first column A_d[:, 0], and \\(y\\) to be the second column A_d[:, 1]. Here’s a scatter plot of all images projected down to 2 dimensions. I can’t make out any patterns in the plot, and you probably can’t either. But at least we’ve found an interesting and sometimes useful way to visualize high-dimensional data.\n\nplt.scatter(A_d[:, 0], A_d[:, 1], s=1, alpha=0.8)\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\nplt.title(f'{m} MNIST Images')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nHow good is our approximation? We can use the singular values to figure this out. In the low rank approximation, we’re keeping \\(d\\) singular values and dropping the remaining \\(k-d\\). Throwing away those remaining singular values is throwing away information about our original matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). To figure out how much information we’re keeping in our approximation, we can just look at the ratio of the sum of singular values kept to the total sum of all singular values,\n\\[R_d = \\frac{\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 + \\cdots + \\sigma_{d-1}}{\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1 + \\cdots + \\sigma_{k-1}}.\\]\nThis ratio is sometimes called the explained variance for reasons I’ll get into in a future lesson.\nIn the rank-2 case I just worked out, this ratio turns out to be \\(R_2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_1}{\\sum \\sigma_i} \\approx 0.087\\). That is, this rank-2 approximation is preserving about 8.7% of the information in the original data.\n\nR_d = np.sum(sigma_d) / np.sum(sigma)\nprint(f'R_d = {R_d}')\n\nR_d = 0.08740669535517863\n\n\nThat’s pretty bad. We can do better. Let’s take \\(d=100\\) and see how well that does. Of course, we won’t be able to plot the data in the xy-plane anymore, but it’ll better represent the original data. We’re now at \\(R_d \\approx 0.643\\), which means we’re preserving about 64.3% of the information in the original data, and we’re doing it using only \\(\\frac{100}{784} \\approx 0.127\\), or 12.7% of the total columns of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\).\n\nd = 100\nU_d, sigma_d, Vt_d = U[:, :d], sigma[:d], Vt[:d, :]\nA_d = A @ Vt_d.T\nprint(f'A_d.shape = {A_d.shape}')\n\nA_d.shape = (1000, 100)\n\n\n\nR_d = np.sum(sigma_d) / np.sum(sigma)\nprint(f'R_d = {R_d}')\n\nR_d = 0.6433751746962163\n\n\nAnother way to see how good our compression is is to “unproject” the compressed images and plot them. To unproject \\(\\mathbf{A}_d\\), just multiply on the right again by \\(\\mathbf{V}^\\top\\) to get the original \\(m \\times n\\) matrix approximation again,\n\\[\\mathbf{A} \\approx \\mathbf{A}_d \\mathbf{V}^\\top.\\]\nOnce I’ve done that, I can just pluck a random row from the approximation, resize it, and plot it using plt.imshow, just like before. Notice this time we can still clearly see the handwritten \\(0\\), but it’s a bit grainer than it was before. The edges aren’t as sharp. Nevertheless, we can still make out the digit pretty solidly.\n\nimg = (A_d @ Vt_d)[0, :].reshape(28, 28)\nplt.imshow(img, cmap='Greys')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nBut why is this approach good for compression anyway? After all, we still have to unproject the rows back into the original \\(m \\times n\\) space. Maybe think about it this way. If you just stored the full matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), you’d have tot store \\(m \\cdot n\\) total numbers. In this example, that’s \\(1000 \\cdot 784 = 784000\\) numbers you’d have to store in memory.\nBut suppose now we do the low rank approximation. What we can then do is just store \\(\\mathbf{A}_d\\) and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) instead. That means we’d instead store \\(m \\cdot d + d \\cdot n\\) total numbers. In our example, that comes out to \\(1000 \\cdot 100 + 100 \\cdot 784 = 100000 + 78400 = 178400\\), which is only \\(\\frac{178400}{784000} \\approx 0.227\\) or 22.7% of the numbers we’d have to store otherwise. We’ve thus compressed our data by a factor of about \\(\\frac{1}{0.227} \\approx 4.4\\). That’s a 4.4x compression of the original images.\nNow, this kind of PCA compression isn’t perfect, or lossless, since we can’t recover the original images exactly. But we can still recover the most fundamental features of the image, which in this case are the handwritten digits. This kind of compression is lossy, since it irreversibly throws away some information in the original data. Yet, it still maintains enough information to be useful in many settings."

    "text": "Randomness\nProbability is a calculus for modeling random processes. There are things we just can’t predict with certainty given the information we have available. Stuff that we can’t predict with certainty we call random, or noise, or non-deterministic. Stuff we can predict with certainty we call deterministic or certain. Here are some examples of these two kinds of processes. The questions in the deterministic column have exact answers, while those in the random column do not.\nDeterministic processes aren’t terribly interesting. They either will occur with certainty, or they won’t. Random processes might occur. To quantify what we mean by might we’ll introduce the notion of probability. You can think of probability as a function mapping questions like “Will it rain today?” to a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) that indicates our “degree of belief” in whether that question is true,\n\\[0 \\leq \\mathbb{Pr}(\\text{Will it rain today?}) \\leq 1.\\]\nThe question inside this probability function is called an event. An event is anything that might occur. Mathematically speaking, an event is a set that lives in some abstract sample space of all possible outcomes.\nWhen we’re certain an event will occur we say it has probability one, or a 100% chance of happening. When we’re certain an event will not occur we say it has probability zero, or a 0% chance of happening. These extremes are deterministic processes. Random processes are anything in between. For the question “Will it rain today?”, we might say there is a 20% chance of rain, in which case we believe \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(\\text{Will it rain today?}) = 0.2\\).\nA common theme we’ll see in machine learning is that we’re interested in mapping arbitrary data structures like strings to numerical data structures that we can do mathematical calculations with, like floats or arrays. In this particular example, it’s convenient to map the question “Will it rain today?” to a binary variable I’ll call \\(x\\), \\[\nx =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{It will rain today} \\\\\n0, & \\text{It will not rain today}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThen asking for \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(\\text{Will it rain today?})\\) is the same thing as asking “what is the probability that \\(x=1\\)”, or equivalently, what is \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x=1)\\)? Saying we believe there’s a 20% chance of rain today is equivalent to saying we believe there is a 20% chance that \\(x=1\\), i.e. \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x=1)=0.2\\).\nVariables like \\(x\\) are called random variables. They’re a way of encoding random events numerically via some kind of encoding convention like I just used. It’s much more convenient to work with random variables than events or questions since we can now use all our usual mathematical tools like calculus and linear algebra to understand random processes.\nTo understand how random variables work, it’s often helpful to think of them as the outputs of random number generators. These are algorithms that generate, or sample, random numbers from some given distribution. Unlike regular functions, where a given input will always produce a definite output, a random number generator can (and usually will) produce different outputs every single time the same input is passed in.\nThe canonical example of a random number generator is called rand. It’s an algorithm for uniformly generating (pseudo) random real numbers \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\). Every time we call rand we’ll get a different number with no clear pattern.\nHere’s an example. I’ll call rand via the numpy function np.random.rand a bunch of times and print the first 10 outputs. Notice how all over the place they seem to be. The only thing we know is they’re between zero and one.\nThink of a random variable informally as being some variable \\(x\\) whose values are determined by a function \\(x=f(n)\\), except the function can’t make up its mind or follow a pattern. On one sampling we might get \\(x=f(0)=0.548\\). Next, \\(x=f(1)=0.715\\). Next, \\(x=f(2)=0.603\\). Etc. We can’t force \\(x\\) to take on a definite value. It jumps around with no clear pattern.\nSince random variable outputs jump around like this we need a different way to visualize them than just thinking of them as points on the number line. The most useful way to visualize random variables is using a histogram. To create a histogram, we sample a random variable a whole bunch of times, and plot a count of how many times the variable takes on each given value. We then show these counts in a bar chart with the heights indicating the counts for each value.\nIn matplotlib we can plot histograms of an array of samples x using the function plt.hist(x). Here’s an example. I’ll sample 100 values from rand and put them in an array x, then plot the histogram.\nNotice that we just sampled \\(100\\) different values, but we don’t see \\(100\\) different bars. That’s because histograms don’t plot bars for all values. First, the values get binned into some number of equally spaced subintervals, called bins, then the counts that get plotted are the counts of values inside each bin. In this case, the histogram divides the samples into \\(10\\) equally spaced bins. If you look carefully you should see \\(10\\) bars in the plot. We can change the number of bins by passing in a keyword bins specifying how many bints to take.\nSince I’ll be using histograms a lot in this lesson I’m going to write a helper function plot_histogram to bundle up the code to plot them nicely. Instead of using plt.hist, however, I’ll use the seaborn library’s sns.histplot, which creates much nicer looking histograms. Seaborn is an extension library of matplotlib made specifically for making nicer plots of data. Ignore the is_discrete argument for now. I’ll use it in the next section.\nIt’s still kind of hard to see if the \\(100\\) rand samples have any kind of pattern in the above histogram plot. Let’s now sample 10,000 numbers from rand and see if we can find one.\nIt should be increasingly clear now that what’s going on is that rand is sampling numbers between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Each bin should contain roughly \\(\\frac{10000}{10}=1000\\) counts, since there are \\(10000\\) samples and \\(10\\) bins. Said differently, the values in each bin should have a \\(\\frac{1}{10}=0.1\\) probability of being sampled. For example, the values in the left-most bin, call it \\(I_0 = [0, 0.1]\\) should have\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in I_0) = \\mathbb{Pr}(0 \\leq x \\leq 0.1) = 0.1.\\]\nThis type of “flat”, equal probability sampling is called uniform random sampling.\nYou may be questioning that it’s indeed the case that each bin is truly getting sampled as much as the other bins. After all, the plot still clearly shows their heights vary a bit. Some bins have slightly more values than others do. We can look at how many counts are in the bin using np.histogram, which also defaults to \\(10\\) bins. You can see some bins have as many as \\(1037\\) values, some as few as \\(960\\) values.\nDiscrete random variables are variables that can only take on a discrete range of values. Usually this range is a finite set like \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) or \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) or something like that. But they could have an infinite range too, for example the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of all non-negative integers. Rand is not an example of a discrete random variable, since there the range is all of the interval \\([0,1]\\).\nHere are some examples of real life things that can be modeled by a discrete random variable: - Modeling the rolls of a die with faces \\(1,2,3,4,5,6\\). - Modeling values from flipping a coin taking on a value of heads or tails. - Modeling a hand of poker, where there are 5 cards each drawn from the same deck of 52 cards. - Modeling the outputs of data used to train a machine learning classification model. - Modeling the number of heads gotten from flipping a coin a whole bunch of times. - Modeling the number of people entering a building per hour.\nSo far we’ve covered discrete random variables, ones that take on a finite (or countably infinite) set of values. We can also consider random variables that take on a continuous range of values. For example, a continuous random variable \\(x\\) can take on values in the entire interval \\([0,1]\\), or the whole real line \\(\\mathbb{R} = (-\\infty, \\infty)\\). The key difference between continuous variables and discrete variables is that we have to think in terms of calculus now. Instead of points we’ll have infinitesimal areas. Instead of sums we’ll have integrals.\nIt may not be obvious to you that there are practical examples where continuous random variables would be useful. Here are some examples: - Modeling the behavior of random number generators like rand. - Modeling the total sales a business will do next quarter. - Modeling the time it takes for a customer to complete a purchase in an online store. - Modeling the amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle on a given day. - Modeling the height of waves in the ocean at a given time. - Modeling the length of a stay in a hospital by a typical patient. - Modeling the amount of rainfall in a specific region over a period of time. - Modeling the measured voltage of a car battery at any point in time.\nIn fact, any continuous variable you can think of could be treated as random depending on the situation. Even if a variable is completely deterministic, there may be situations where it’s helpful to think of it as random. The whole idea of Monte Carlo methods is based on this idea, in fact."

    "section": "Motivation: Rolling a Die",
    "text": "Motivation: Rolling a Die\nConsider a very simple toy problem: rolling a die (singular of dice). If you’ve never seen dice before, they’re white cubes with black dots on each face of the cube. Each face gets some number of black dots on it between 1 and 6. People like to “roll” these dice in games by shaking and tossing them onto the ground. The person with the highest score, i.e. the most number of dots facing upward, wins that round.\n\n\n🎲\n\n\nLet’s think a little bit about a single die. Suppose I want to roll a single die. Having not rolled the die yet, what should I “expect” the value to be when I roll the die? Call this score \\(x\\). The possible values I can have are just the number of dots on each face of the die, i.e. \\(1,2,3,4,5,6\\). This alone doesn’t tell me what the chance is that any given \\(x\\) turns up in a roll. We need some other information.\nPerhaps your common sense kicks in and you think, “Well clearly each number has an equal chance of showing up if you roll the die”. This is called the principle of indifference. In practice you’d usually be right. You’re saying that, since we don’t have any other information to go on, each number should have an equal chance of showing up on each roll. That is, on any given roll, the random variable \\(x\\) should take on each value \\(k=1,2,\\cdots,6\\) with probability,\n\\[p_k = \\mathbb{Pr}(x=k) = \\frac{1}{6}.\\]\nThis just says that the probability of rolling \\(x=1\\) is \\(p_1 = \\frac{1}{6}\\), the probability of rolling \\(x=2\\) is also \\(p_2 = \\frac{1}{6}\\), etc. Notice that these probabilities satisfy two properties that all probabilities must satisfy: 1. Each probability is non-negative: \\(p_k = \\frac{1}{6} \\geq 0\\), 2. The sum of all the possible probabilities is one: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^6 p_k = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = 1\\).\nThese two properties are the defining characteristics of a probability. The second condition is just a mathematical way of saying that rolling the die must return some value \\(x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). It can’t just make up some new value, or refuse to answer.\nAnyway, suppose I rolled the die \\(N=36\\) times and got the following values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n\n\n\n\nValue\n3\n4\n5\n4\n3\n1\n3\n6\n5\n2\n1\n5\n4\n2\n1\n1\n1\n6\n5\n6\n3\n5\n5\n3\n3\n6\n6\n1\n5\n4\n2\n2\n4\n6\n2\n4\n\n\n\nWe can make a histogram out of these and check the principle of indifference by verifying the bins are all of about the same height (at least as close to the same as only 30 rolls will allow). Note that I’m now using is_discrete=True here, which tells the helper function to give each unique \\(k\\) its own bin.\n\nx = [3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 1, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 5, 6, 3, 5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 5, 4, 2, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4]\nplot_histogram(x, is_discrete=True, title='36 Die Rolls')\n\n\n\n\nGiven the fact that I only rolled \\(36\\) times, this histogram looks very uniform, giving a pretty strong hint that each value has an equal probability of being rolled. Since most bars have height \\(6\\), they correspond to probabilities of \\(\\frac{6}{36}=\\frac{1}{6}\\), which is what our common sense expected. Note the counts can fluctuate in this case in a range of about \\(6 \\pm 2\\). This is an example of a fair die.\nWhat if our common sense was incorrect? What if I rolled the die a bunch of times and found out some numbers occurred a lot more often than others? This would happen if the die were weighted unevenly, or loaded. In this case we’re left to assign some weight \\(N\\) to each number \\(k\\).\nTo determine what the right weights should be empirically, probably the easiest way would again be to roll the die a bunch of times and count how many times each value \\(k\\) occurs. Those counts will be your weights \\(N_k\\). These are just the heights of each bin in the histogram. To turn them into probabilities \\(p_k\\), divide by the total number of rolls, call it \\(N\\). The probabilities would then be given approximately by\n\\[p_k = \\mathbb{Pr}(x=k) \\approx \\frac{N_k}{N}.\\]\nThat is, the probability \\(p_k\\) is just a ratio of counts, the fraction of times \\(x=k\\) occurred in \\(N\\) counts. As \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) this equality goes from approximate to exact. In fact, we could define the probability \\(p_k = \\mathbb{Pr}(x=k)\\) as the limit\n\\[p_k = \\mathbb{Pr}(x=k) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N_k}{N}.\\]\nThis is an alternate way of defining a probability, different from the “degree of belief” approach I used above. This is usually called the frequentist or objective approach. In this approach, probability is the frequency of the number of times an outcome occurs in an experiment, i.e. \\(\\frac{N_k}{N}\\). In contrast, the “degree of belief” perspective is called the Bayesian or subjective approach. Both approaches have their uses, so we’ll go back and forth between the two as it suits us.\nTo test if your die is loaded, what you can do is roll the die \\(N\\) trials and calculate the probabilities. If they’re all roughly equal to \\(1/6\\) like the example above then the die is fair. Otherwise it’s loaded. Suppose when I’d rolled the die I’d instead gotten the following outcomes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n\n\n\n\nValue\n4\n4\n5\n4\n3\n5\n3\n6\n5\n6\n1\n5\n4\n5\n6\n5\n1\n6\n5\n6\n3\n5\n5\n4\n3\n6\n6\n4\n5\n4\n2\n5\n4\n6\n2\n4\n\n\n\nLet’s plot the histogram of these outcomes and compare to the fair die case.\n\nx = [4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 3, 6, 5, 6, 1, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 1, 6, 5, 6, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 6, 6, 4, 5, 4, 2, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4]\nplot_histogram(x, is_discrete=True, title='36 Die Rolls (Round 2)')\n\n\n\n\nNotice how now the outcomes are skewed towards higher values. This clearly doesn’t look uniform anymore since most of the counts aren’t in the expected range of \\(6 \\pm 2\\). The die has been “loaded to roll high”.\nUsing the experimental approach we can estimate what the probability of rolling each value is. To do that, we can just take each value \\(k\\) and sum up the number of times \\(x=k\\) and divide it by the total counts \\(N\\). This will return an array of probabilities, where each index \\(k\\) contains the entry \\(p_{k+1} = \\frac{N_k}{N}\\).\n\nsupport = np.unique(x)\nN = len(x)\nNk = [sum([x == k]) for k in support]\np = Nk / N\n[f\"Pr(x={i+1}) = {round(p[i], 3)}\" for i in range(len(p))]\n\n['Pr(x=1) = 0.056',\n 'Pr(x=2) = 0.056',\n 'Pr(x=3) = 0.111',\n 'Pr(x=4) = 0.25',\n 'Pr(x=5) = 0.306',\n 'Pr(x=6) = 0.222']"

    "text": "General Case\nOf course, there’s nothing special about a die. We can define probabilities in exactly the same way for any discrete random variable. A random variable \\(x\\) is called discrete if it can take on one of \\(n\\) countable values \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}\\). Suppose we run an experiment \\(n\\) times and observe the outcomes of \\(x\\) at each trial. If \\(x=x_k\\) for some number of counts \\(n_j\\), then the probability \\(x=x_k\\) is given by the limit of running the experiment infinitely many times,\n\\[p_k = \\mathbb{Pr}(x=k) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N_k}{N}.\\]\nThe set of values that \\(x\\) can take on are called the support of the random variable. For values outside the support, it’s assumed the probability is zero. As will always be true with probabilities, it’s still the case that each probability must be non-negative, and they must all sum to one,\n\\[p_k \\geq 0, \\quad \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} p_k = 1.\\]\nWhile we have an experimental way to calculate probabilities now, it would be useful to define probabilities as functions of random variables so we can study them mathematically. These functions are called probability distributions. Suppose the probabilities \\(p_k\\) are given by some function \\(p(x)\\) mapping outcomes to probabilities. When this is true, we say \\(x\\) is distributed as \\(p(x)\\), written in short-hand as \\(x \\sim p(x)\\). If \\(x\\) is discrete, we call the function \\(p(x)\\) a probability mass function, or PMF for short.\nIn the simple case of the fair die, since each \\(p_k = \\frac{1}{6}\\), its PMF is just the simple constant function \\(p(x) = \\frac{1}{6}\\). This distribution is an example of the discrete uniform distribution. If \\(x\\) is a discrete random variable taking on one of \\(k\\) outcomes, and \\(x\\) is distributed as discrete uniform, then its probabilities are given by \\(p_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\) for all \\(k\\). In histogram language, all bins have approximately the same number of counts.\nIn the less simple case of the loaded die we had to estimate each probability empirically. Supposing we could calculate those probabilities exactly, the PMF for that particular loaded die would look like\n\\[\np(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0.056, & x = 1, \\\\\n0.056, & x = 2, \\\\\n0.111, & x = 3, \\\\\n0.250, & x = 4, \\\\\n0.306, & x = 5, \\\\\n0.220, & x = 6.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis is an example of a categorical distribution. Their histograms can look completely arbitrary. Each bin can contain as many counts as it likes. All that matters is that \\(k\\) is finite and all the probabilities sum to one. Any time you take a discrete uniform random variable and weigh the outcomes (e.g. by loading a die) you’ll create a categorical distribution.\nTypically each distribution will have one or more parameters \\(\\theta\\) that can be adjusted to change the shape or support of the distribution. Instead of writing \\(p(x)\\) for the PMF, when we want to be explicit about the parameters we’ll sometimes write \\(p(x; \\theta)\\). The semi-colon is used to say that any arguments listed after it are understood to be parameters, not function inputs. In this notation, parameters of a distribution are assumed to be known, non-random values. We’ll relax this requirement below, but assume parameters are non-random for now.\nFor example, the discrete uniform distribution has two parameters indicating the lowest and highest values in the support, called \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). We could thus express its PMF as \\(p(x;a,b)\\), which means “the probability of \\(x\\) given known parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)”.\nUsing these parameters, it’s also common to use special symbols as a short-hand for common distributions. For example, the discrete uniform distribution with parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is often shortened to something like \\(DU(a,b)\\). If we want to say \\(x\\) is a discrete uniform random variable, we’d write \\(x \\sim DU(a,b)\\). You’ll also sometimes see people use the symbol to write the PMF as well, for example \\(DU(x;a,b)\\)."

    "section": "Probabilities of Multiple Outcomes",
    "text": "Probabilities of Multiple Outcomes\nWe’ve seen how to calculate the probabilities of any one outcome. The probability that \\(x=k\\) is given by \\(\\text{Pr}(x=k) = p(k)\\), where \\(p(k)\\) is the PMF. It’s natural to then ask how we can think about probabilities of multiple outcomes. For example, consider again the situation of rolling a fair die. Suppose we were interested in knowing what the probability was of rolling an even number, i.e. \\(x=2,4,6\\). How would we approach this? Your intuition suggests the right idea. We can just sum the probabilities of each outcome together,\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x\\text{ is even}) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x=2,4,6) = p(2) + p(4) + p(6) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nThis same idea extends to any discrete set. Suppose we’re interested in the probability that some discrete random variable \\(x\\) takes on values in some set \\(E = \\{x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_{m-1}\\}\\). Then all we need to do is some over the probabilities of all the outcomes in \\(E\\), i.e.\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in E) = \\sum_{k \\in E} p(k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} p(x_i) = p(x_0) + p(x_1) + \\cdots p(x_{m-1}).\\]\nWhen the set of interest is the entire support of \\(x\\), the right-hand side is just the sum the probability of all possible outcome, which is just one. Thus, we’ll always have \\(0 \\leq \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in E) \\leq 1\\) for any set \\(E\\).\nThough we don’t really have to for discrete variables, it’s conventional to define another function \\(P(x)\\) called the cumulative distribution function, or CDF. It’s the probability \\(x \\in (-\\infty, x_0]\\) for some fixed value \\(x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\),\n\\[P(x_0) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\leq x_0) = \\sum_{k \\leq x_0} p(k) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\text{int}(x_0)} p(k),\\]\nwhere it’s understood that \\(p(k)=0\\) whenever \\(k\\) isn’t in the support of \\(x\\). Note the CDF is a real-valued function. We can ask about \\(P(x_0)\\) for any \\(x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), not just discrete values of \\(x_0\\).\nBut why should we care? It turns out if we know the CDF in some simple form, we can use it to calculate the probability \\(x\\) is in any other interval by differencing the CDF at the endpoints. Suppose we’re interested in the probability \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\). If we know the CDF for a particular distribution in some simple form, we can just difference it to get the probability of being in the interval, i.e.\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(a \\leq x \\leq b) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\leq b) - \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\leq a) = P(b) - P(a).\\]\nThis fact is more useful for continuous distributions than discrete ones, since in the discrete case we can always just sum over the values, which is usually pretty quick to do.\n\nApplication: Getting a Job\nHere’s a useful application where probabilities of multiple outcomes can sometimes come in handy. Suppose you’re applying to a bunch of jobs, and you want to know what is the probability that you’ll get at least one offer. Suppose you’ve applied to \\(n\\) jobs. For simplicity, assume each job has roughly the same probability \\(\\text{p}\\) of giving you an offer. Then each job application looks kind of like the situation of flipping a coin. If \\(x_i=1\\) you get an offer, if \\(x_i=0\\) you get rejected. We can thus think of each job application as a Bernoulli random variable \\(x_i \\sim \\text{Ber}(\\text{p})\\).\nNow, assume that the job applications are all independent of each other, so one company’s decision whether to give you an offer doesn’t affect another company’s decision to give you an offer. This isn’t perfectly true, but it’s reasonably true. In this scenario, the total number of offers \\(x\\) you get out of \\(n\\) job applications will then be binomially distributed, \\(x \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, \\text{p})\\).\nWe can use this fact to answer the question we started out with: What is the probability that you receive at least one offer? It’s equivalent to asking, if \\(x\\) is binomial, what is the probability that \\(x \\geq 1\\)? Now, since \\(x\\) is only supported on non-negative values, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\geq 1) &= \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\geq 0) - \\mathbb{Pr}(x=0) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\mathbb{Pr}(x=0) \\\\\n&= 1 - p(0;n,\\text{p}) \\\\\n&= 1 - \\binom{n}{0} \\text{p}^0 (1-\\text{p})^{n-0} \\\\\n&= 1 - \\frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!} (1-\\text{p})^n \\\\\n&= 1 - (1-\\text{p})^n.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nWe thus have a formula. The probability of receiving at least one job offer from applying to \\(n\\) jobs, assuming each gives an offer with probability \\(\\text{p}\\), and applications are independent of each other, is\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(\\text{at least one offer}) = 1 - (1-\\text{p})^n.\\]\nHere’s an example of how this formula can be useful. Suppose you believe you have a 10% chance of getting an offer from any one company you apply to, so \\(\\text{p}=0.1\\). If you apply to \\(n=10\\) jobs, you’ll have about a 34.86% chance of receiving at least one offer.\n\np = 0.1\nn = 10\nprob_offer = 1 - (1 - p) ** n\nprob_offer\n\n0.6513215599\n\n\nLet’s now ask how many jobs you’d have to apply to to give yourself at least a 90% chance of getting at least one job offer? Here’s what you can do. Let \\(O = \\mathbb{Pr}(\\text{at least one offer})\\), so \\(O = (1-p)^n\\). Set \\(O=0.9\\) and solve for \\(n\\). Then you’d have\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nO &= 1 - (1-p)^n \\\\\n(1-p)^n &= 1 - O \\\\\nn \\log(1-p) &= \\log(1 - O) \\\\\nn &= \\frac{\\log(1 - O)}{\\log(1 - p)}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nPlugging in \\(p=0.1\\) and \\(O=0.9\\) gives \\(n \\approx 21.85\\). Thus, you’d need to apply to at least \\(n=22\\) jobs to have a decent chance of getting at least one offer. Here’s a plot of this idea. Each curve is a plot of \\(n=n(p)\\) for different choices of \\(O\\), in this case, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 99%.\n\np = np.linspace(0.01, 0.999, 100)\nO = [0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 0.99]\nfor o in O:\n    n = np.log(1 - o) / np.log(1 - p)\n    plt.plot(p, n, label=f'$O={round(o*100)}$%')\nplt.xticks(0.1 * np.arange(11))\nplt.ylim(0, 70)\nplt.title(\n    \"\"\"How many jobs would you have to \n    apply to to get at least one job offer\n    with confidence $O$?\"\"\".title(), fontsize=11)\nplt.xlabel('$p$')\nplt.ylabel('$n$')\nplt.grid(True, alpha=0.5)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe moral of this story is that you have two ways to up your chances of getting a job offer: Up your chances of getting any one job (i.e. increase \\(p\\)), or apply to a lot more jobs (i.e. increase \\(n\\)). The more confident you want to be of getting an offer (i.e. \\(O\\)), the more jobs you’ll need to apply to. This same idea can be used to model the probability of at least one occurrence for any binary event similar to this."

    "section": "Motivation: Rand Again",
    "text": "Motivation: Rand Again\nI showed example of a continuous random variable already at the beginning of this lesson, when I introduced the idea of random number generators like rand. Rand is an example of a function that can (approximately) generate samples of a continuous random variable. In particular, it samples uniformly from the interval \\([0,1]\\). I already showed what its histogram looks like for a large number of samples. Here it is again.\n\nx = np.random.rand(10000)\nplot_histogram(x, bins=10, title=f'rand({10000})')\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now try to figure out how we should define the probability of values sampled from rand. In the discrete case, we were able to define probabilities by running an experiment (e.g. rolling a die a bunch of times). We could look at the ratio of the number of times \\(N_k\\) an outcome \\(k\\) occurred over the number of total trials \\(N\\). This made sense in the discrete case since we could reasonably well rely on each outcome \\(x=k\\) occurring enough times to get a meaningful count.\nThis approach doesn’t work well for continuous random variables. Suppose \\(x\\) is the random variable resulting from rand, uniform on the interval \\([0,1]\\). If I sample a single value from rand, there’s no reason to assume I’ll ever see that exact value again. There are uncountably infinitely many values to choose from in \\([0,1]\\), so I’m pretty much guaranteed to never see the same value twice. Instead of counting how many times each value occurs, what I can do is use the binning trick we saw with histograms. For example, I can divide \\([0,1]\\) up into ten subintervals (or bins)\n\\[I_0=[0,0.1], \\quad I_1=[0.1,0.2], \\quad I_3=[0.2,0.3], \\quad \\cdots, \\quad I_9=[0.9,1].\\]\nIf I sample one value from rand it’s guaranteed to be in one of these subintervals \\(I_k\\). If I sample a whole bunch of values from rand, say \\(N=1000\\), I should expect each \\(I_k\\) to contain about \\(N_k=100\\) counts (10% of the total since there are 10 bins). It thus seems to make perfect sense to define a probability on each \\(I_k\\),\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in I_k) = \\frac{N_k}{N} = \\frac{100}{1000} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1.\\]\n\nN = 10000\nM = 10\ndx = 1 / M\nx = np.random.rand(N)\nplot_histogram(x, bins=M, title=f'M=${M}$ subintervals of length $dx={dx}$')\n\n\n\n\nWe still want to approximate the discrete idea of having a probability \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x=k)\\). How can we do it using this idea of subintervals? Enter calculus. What we can imagine doing is allowing each subinterval \\(I_k\\) to become infinitesimally small. Suppose we subdivide \\([0,1]\\) into \\(M\\) total subintervals each of infinitesimal length \\(dx\\), satisfying \\(M=\\frac{1}{dx}\\), i.e.\n\\[I_0=[0,dx], \\quad I_1=[dx, 2dx], \\quad I_2=[2dx, 3dx], \\quad \\cdots, \\quad I_{M-1}=[(M-1)dx, 1].\\]\nSuppose \\(x_0\\) is some point in one of these tiny intervals \\(I_k=[kdx, (k+1)dx]\\). Since each \\(I_k\\) is a very tiny interval, the probability that \\(x \\approx x_0\\) is pretty much exactly the same thing as the probability that \\(x \\in I_k\\). Let’s thus define the probability that \\(x \\approx x_0\\) as the probability that \\(x \\in I_k\\),\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in I_k) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N_k}{N}.\\]\nHere’s an approximate representation of this idea. I won’t be able to make \\(M=10^{300}\\) bins like I’d like, but I can at least make bins so you can see the point. I’ll need to generate a huge number of samples \\(N\\) so the histogram will populate. Notice each \\(N_k \\approx \\frac{N}{M} = 1000\\). That is,\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0) \\approx \\frac{N_k}{N} \\approx \\frac{N/M}{N} = \\frac{1}{M} = dx.\\]\nEvidently, the probability \\(x \\approx x_0\\) is infinitesimal, so very very tiny. This is why you’ll basically never sample the same value twice.\n\nN = 1000000\nM = N // 1000\ndx = 1 / M\nx = np.random.rand(N)\nplot_histogram(x, bins=M, title=f'M=${M}$ subintervals of length $dx={dx}$')"

    "text": "General Case\nThe facts I’ve shown about rand extend to more general continuous random variables as well. Suppose \\(x\\) is supported on some interval \\([a,b]\\). It could even be infinite. Let’s divide this interval up into \\(M\\) tiny sub-intervals of length \\(dx\\), where \\(M\\) must satisfy \\(M = \\frac{b-a}{dx}\\),\n\\[I_0=[a,a+dx], \\quad I_1=[a+dx, a+2dx], \\quad I_2=[a+2dx, a+3dx], \\quad \\cdots, \\quad I_{M-1}=[a+(M-1)dx, b].\\]\nNow, run an experiment \\(N\\) times and count how many times outcomes occur, not for each \\(x\\), but for each subinterval \\(I_k=[a+kdx, a+(k+1)dx]\\). If \\(x_0 \\in I_k\\), that is, if \\(a+kdx \\leq x_0 \\leq a+(k+1)dx\\), then the probability that \\(x \\approx x_0\\) is defined by,\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in I_k) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N_k}{N}.\\]\nJust as with the uniform case before, it’s useful to think of the probability \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0)\\) as explicitly being proportional to the subinterval length \\(dx\\). In the uniform case it was just \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0)=dx\\) exactly. In the more general case, \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0)\\) may depend on the value of \\(x_0\\), so we need to weight the right-hand side by some non-negative weighting function \\(p(x) \\geq 0\\), so\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx  x_0) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in I_k) = p(x_0)dx.\\]\nThis weighting function \\(p(x)\\) is called the probability density function, or PDF for short. It’s the continuous analogue of the probability mass function from the discrete case (hence why I use the same notation). Unlike the discrete PMF, the PDF is not a probability all by itself. It’s a probability per infinitesimal unit \\(dx\\). That is, it’s a density. For this reason, the PDF need not sum to one. It only needs to be non-negative, i.e. all outputs \\(p(x_0)\\) should lie on or above the x-axis, never below it. But any one output \\(p(x_0)\\) can be arbitrarily large, even \\(\\infty\\)!\nWhat must be true is that all probabilities sum to one. Since each \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x \\approx x_0)\\) is infinitesimal now, this means all probablities must integrate to one over the support of \\(x\\). If \\(x\\) is supported on \\([a,b]\\), then\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(a \\leq x \\leq b) = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\in I_k) = \\int_a^b p(x)dx = 1.\\]\nThis means we can think of a PDF as being any non-negative function that integrates to one. In fact, any function that satisfies this property is a valid PDF for some continuous random variable.\nSpecifying the functional form of the PDF \\(p(x)\\) creates a continuous probability distribution. By specifying \\(p(x)\\), we’ve uniquely specified what the probabilities have to be for the variable \\(x\\). In the next section I’ll define some of the most common continuous distributions.\nJust as with discrete probabilities, we can get the probability that \\(x\\) is in any set by summing over all the values in that set. The only difference is we replace the sum with an integral over the set. For example, the probability that \\(c \\leq x \\leq d\\) is given by\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(c \\leq x \\leq d) = \\int_c^d p(x)dx.\\]\nWe can also define a cumulative distribution function \\(P(x)\\) for continuous probabilities in exactly the same way, except again replacing sums with integrals,\n\\[P(x_0) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x \\leq x_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x_0} p(x')dx',\\]\nwhere it’s understood that \\(p(x')=0\\) whenever \\(x'\\) is outside the support of \\(x\\).\nIf we can obtain the CDF for a distribution, we can calculate the probability \\(x\\) is in any set without having to evaluate an integral. For example, if the set is again the interval \\([c,d]\\), then\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(c \\leq x \\leq d) = P(d) - P(a).\\]\nThis is just a restatement of the rule for definite integrals from the calculus lesson, if \\(f(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}F(x)\\), then\n\\[\\int_c^d f(x) dx = F(d) - F(c).\\]\nTo show a brief example, I’ll calculate the CDF of the rand distribution shown already, where \\(x\\) is uniform on \\([0,1]\\). I already showed that its PDF is just \\(p(x)=1\\) for all \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\). Outside this interval \\(p(x)=0\\) everywhere. Using the PDF I can calculate the CDF by integrating. There are three cases to consider. If \\(x < 0\\), the CDF will just be \\(P(x)=0\\) since \\(p(x)=0\\). If \\(x > 1\\), \\(P(x) = 1\\) since we’re integrating over the whole support \\([0,1]\\). Otherwise, we’re integrating over some subinterval \\([0,x]\\), in which case \\(P(x)=x\\). That is,\n\\[\nP(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x p(x') dx' =\n\\begin{cases}\n0, & x < 0 \\\\\nx, & 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 \\\\\n1, & x > 1.\n\\end{cases}\\]\nHere’s a plot of both the PDF and CDF of rand. Notice the PDF is just the constant \\(p(x)=1\\) on \\([0,1]\\), whose area under the curve is just one, since the total probability must integrate to one. Also, notice how this same area is the exact same thing that the histogram tries to approximate. In fact, a histogram is just a discrete approximation to the area under a continuous PDF.\nFor the CDF, notice how the function starts at \\(P(x)=0\\) on the far left, and ramps up monotonically to \\(P(x)=1\\) as \\(x\\) increases. Every CDF will have this property. The only difference is what the ramp looks like. It’ll always be the case that \\(P(-\\infty)=0\\), \\(P(\\infty)=1\\), and some monotonic increasing curve connects these two extremes.\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\np = lambda x: np.ones(len(x))\nplot_function(x, p, xlim=(-0.5, 1.5), ylim=(-0.5, 1.5), set_ticks=True, title='Rand PDF')\n\n\n\n\n\nx = np.linspace(-1, 2, 100)\nP = lambda x: np.clip(x, 0, 1) # quick way to define the piecewise CDF shown above\nplot_function(x, P, xlim=(-1, 2), ylim=(-0.5, 1.5), title='Rand CDF')"

    "section": "Two Random Variables",
    "text": "Two Random Variables\nIn the last lesson we saw the problem of rolling a single die. Suppose now we roll two dice. What is the probability that any pair of dots will turn up? One way to think about this problem is to imagine two random variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), each representing the roll of each die. Now, let’s do just like we did with the single die. Assume you have no other information to go on. What would you guess the probability of rolling any \\((x,y)\\) pair of values should be?\nIf you again employ the principle of indifference, you’d argue as follows: Since \\(x\\) can take on 6 values, and \\(y\\) can also take on 6 values, then the pair \\((x,y)\\) together can take on \\(6 \\cdot 6 = 36\\) possible pairs of values,\n\\[(x,y) = (1,1), (1,2), \\cdots, (1,6), \\cdots, (6,1), (6,2), \\cdots, (6,6).\\]\nThus, each pair of rolls should take an equal probability of \\(p_{x,y} = \\frac{1}{36}\\). Let’s try to unpack the assumptions here. For one thing, we’re assuming each die is fair. That is, the two dice rolled individually should each have equal probabilities \\(p_x = \\frac{1}{6}\\) and \\(p_y = \\frac{1}{6}\\). But, observe that for each pair of values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we have\n\\[p_{x,y} = \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = p_x \\cdot p_y.\\]\nThis is a stronger assumption than assuming the dice are fair. We’re also assuming that they don’t affect each other at all. Rolling \\(x\\) says nothing about what we’d get from rolling \\(y\\), and vice versa. If this fact weren’t true, then we couldn’t get a uniform value for all pairs. Some pair would have a different probability.\nIn probability, this pair of random variables \\((x,y)\\) is called a joint random variable, or a random vector. The probability a random vector takes on any two particular particular values, say \\(x=i\\) and \\(y=j\\), is called the joint probability of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), written \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x=i, y=j)\\). The probabilities of each variable acting alone, i.e. \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x=i)\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(y=j)\\), are called the marginal probabilities. Instead of saying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) don’t affect each other, we say the two random variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are statistically independent. Evidently, if they are independent their joint probability factors into a product of marginal probabilities,\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}\\big(x=i, y=j\\big) = \\mathbb{Pr}\\big(x=i\\big) \\cdot \\mathbb{Pr}\\big(y=j\\big).\\]\nHere’s an experiment mimicking the rolling of two fair, independent dice. What I’ll do is simulate rolling each die 10,000 times by sampling from their “fair die” distributions \\(x \\sim DU(1,7)\\) and \\(y \\sim DU(1,7)\\) each separately 10,000 times. I’ll then use the helper function plot_joint_histogram to do the plotting. You can see from the histogram that things do look more or less uniform if we sample each die fairly and independently. Note since each bin should have an expected count of \\(\\frac{10000}{36} \\approx 278\\), each bin’s count can fluctuate within a range of about \\(278 \\pm 17\\) and still be uniform.\n\nx = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=10000)\ny_indep = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=10000)\n\nplot_joint_histogram([x, y_indep], title='Two Independent Fair Dice', figsize=(8,4))\n\n\n\n\nJust as in the univariate case, we can model probabilities of two variables as a ratio of counts per number of trials. If we run \\(N\\) trials (in the above example \\(N=10000\\)), and count the number of times \\(N_{i,j}\\) each pair \\(i,j\\) occurs, then the joint probability \\(\\mathbb{Pr}(x=i,y=j)\\) is given by the ratio of counts per number of trials as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\),\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}\\big(x=i,y=j\\big) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N_{i,j}}{N}.\\]\nWe can then define a joint distribution by specifying a PMF of two variables \\(p(x,y)\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent the joint distribution will factor,\n\\[p(x,y) = p(x) \\cdot p(y).\\]\nIn this example of rolling independent fair dice, since \\(x, y \\sim D(1, 7)\\) and \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent, the joint distribution must be of the form\n\\[(x,y) \\sim DU(1,7) \\cdot DU(1,7).\\]\nThis called a product distribution since it’s just the product of two univariate distributions, in this case each \\(D(1,7)\\).\nWhat if the dice are fair but not independent? Then while each individual roll will be uniform, the pair of dice together won’t be. Here’s an example. Suppose that the dice were somehow rigged to where die \\(x\\) could “communicate” information to die \\(y\\). Every time \\(x\\) rolls, it will tell \\(y\\) to roll one number higher (mod 6).\n\n\n\nx\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\ny\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1\n\n\n\nLet’s run a simulation here by again rolling 10,000 times and plotting the histograms, first the marginal histograms, then the joint histogram. To create the given relationship in the table, we can use the formula \\(y = x \\text{ mod } 6 + 1\\), i.e. y = x % 6 + 1.\n\ny_dep = x % 6 + 1\n\nplot_histogram(x, is_discrete=True, title='$x$')\nplot_histogram(y_dep, is_discrete=True, title='$y$')\nplot_joint_histogram([x, y_dep], title='$(x,y)$')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, plotting the histograms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) individually shows each one still looks quite uniform, hence fair. But when plotted together, we see only 6 of the 36 possible pairs ever show up! Why? Because \\(y\\) depends on \\(x\\). Knowing \\(x\\) gives 100% information to reproduce the values of \\(y\\) (and vice versa). Because of this functional dependence, only 6 unique pairs (the size of \\(x\\)) are possible. In this case, we say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are perfectly correlated.\nWe can see this more starkly doing a 2D histogram plot, which will plot the counts as a heat map with \\(x\\) on the x-axis and \\(y\\) on the y-axis. The cells that are dark blue indicate a lot of counts occurring there, while the white cells indicate few to no counts occurring. You can see only 6 of the 36 cells are being darkened.\n\nplot_hist2d(x, y_indep, title='Two Independent Fair Dice', bins=(6, 6))\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_hist2d(x, y_dep, title='Two Perfectly Correlated Fair Dice', bins=(6, 6))"

If we average this function over all \\(z\\), it tells us how many bits of information are contained in the entire distribution itself. This is called entropy, denoted \\(H\\). I’ll talk about entropy more generally in a future lesson. But, when the distribution is uniform (as in our case), the entropy is just \\(I\\) itself, i.e. \\(H=I\\). If \\(p(z)=\\frac{1}{n}\\) for all \\(z\\), its entropy is \\(H = \\log_2 n\\). That is, we’d need \\(\\log_2 n\\) bits of information to specify any given value \\(x\\) sampled from \\(p(z)\\).\nWe can apply this idea of information to the ratio given above. In that case, it takes \\(H=\\log_2(6) \\approx 2.6\\) bits of information to specify any given \\((x,y)\\) pair, assuming we knew \\(x\\). It looks like even if we knew what \\(x\\) is doing, we’d still need \\(2.6\\) more bits to figure out what \\(y\\) is doing. In fact, that’s the same number of bits contained in \\(p(y)\\), since \\(I=\\log_2(6) \\approx 2.6\\). It seems like knowing what \\(x\\) is is telling us basically nothing about what \\(y\\) is.\nLet’s compare this now with the perfectly correlated case, where \\(p(x)=\\frac{1}{6}\\) for all \\(x\\), but\n\\[\np(x,y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{6}, & (x,y) = (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1) \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIf we take the same ratio again, we’d get\n\\[\n\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & (x,y) = (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1) \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nLooking at the entropy of this ratio, we’d need \\(H=\\log_2(1) = 0\\) bits of information to specify \\((x,y)\\) if \\(x\\) was known. That is, knowing what \\(x\\) is is completely sufficient to tell us what \\(y\\) is. We don’t need to know anything else. We have all the bits we need already by knowing \\(p(x)\\).\nClearly this ratio is important, so we give it a name. We call it the conditional probability of \\(y\\), given \\(x\\), written\n\\[p(y|x) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}.\\]\nIt’s not obvious that this is a valid probability, but it is so long as \\(p(x) \\neq 0\\). It’s always non-negative, and will sum to one over all \\(y\\) values,\n\\[\\sum_j p(y=j|x) = \\sum_j \\frac{p(x,y=j)}{p(x)} = \\frac{p(x)}{p(x)} = 1.\\]\nThe last equality follows from the fact that we can sum over one variable to get the marginal distribution of the other,\n\\[p(x) = \\sum_j p(x,y=j).\\] \\[p(y) = \\sum_i p(x=i,y).\\]\nThis is why they’re called marginal probabilities, because you’re “marginalizing” out the other variables.\nThe random variable \\(y|x\\) (pronounced “y given x”) is different than \\(y\\) or \\(x\\) or \\((x,y)\\). It’s a completely new thing. It’s the variable of \\(y\\) values, assuming we know what \\(x\\) is already. In our perfectly correlated example, if we know that \\(x=1\\), then \\(p(y|x=1) = 1\\) since we then know for certain that \\(y=2\\).\nIn fact, generally \\(y|x\\) won’t even have the same distribution as \\(y\\). The only time \\(y\\) and \\(y|x\\) will have the same distribution is if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent, since in that case \\(p(x,y)=p(x)p(y)\\), so\n\\[p(y|x) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)} = \\frac{p(x)p(y)}{p(x)} = p(y).\\]\nWhen \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) aren’t independent, if the come from a joint distribution \\(p(x,y)\\) people often say they’re conditionally independent, since \\(y|x\\) is always independent of \\(x\\) due to the fact that \\(p(x,y)=p(y|x)p(x)\\).\nBack to the dice roll example, here’s a plot of the histogram for \\(y|x=1\\) in each case, first the independent dice rolls, then the perfectly correlated rolls. The first will contain counts in all 6 bins since \\(p(y|x)=p(y)\\) is uniform. The second will only contain counts in bin 2, since \\(y=2\\) with certainty if \\(x=1\\).\n\nplot_histogram(y_indep[x == 1], is_discrete=True, title='$y|x=1$ (independent case)')\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_histogram(y_dep[x == 1], is_discrete=True, title='$y|x=1$ (perfectly correlated case)')"

    "section": "\\(n\\) Random Variables",
    "text": "\\(n\\) Random Variables\nWhat I just described for two random variables extends to any number of random variables as well. If we have \\(n\\) random variables \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}\\), we can define a random vector out of them, \\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1})\\). As a running example, imagine rolling not just two dice, but \\(n\\) dice. Each dice alone can take on one of 6 values, which means a whole random vector of dice can take on \\(6^n\\) tuples of values. The possible outcomes add up fast!\nThe joint probability of these variables can be defined as the ratio of the number of times \\(n_{i_0,i_1,\\cdots,i_{n-1}}\\) each tuple of values \\((i_0,i_1,\\cdots,i_{n-1})\\) occurs divided by the total number of trials \\(N\\), as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\),\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{i}) = \\mathbb{Pr}(x_0=i_0,x_1=i_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}=i_{n-1}) = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N_{i_0,i_1,\\cdots,i_{n-1}}}{N}.\\]\nWe can also define a joint distribution by specifying a probability mass function \\(p(\\mathbf{x}) = p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1})\\). Then each probability is given by\n\\[\\mathbb{Pr}(\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{i}) = p(\\mathbf{i}) = p(i_0,i_1,\\cdots,i_{n-1}).\\]\nAny distribution gotten by summing over one or more variables is called a marginal distribution. We can have \\(n\\) marginal distributions \\(p_0(x_0), p_1(x_1), \\cdots, p_{n-1}(x_{n-1})\\), as well as marginals of any pairs of random variables \\(p_{i,j}(x_i,x_j)\\), or triplets \\(p_{i,j,k}(x_i,x_j,x_k)\\), etc.\nIndependence extends as well. Two variables \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\) are independent if their bivariate marginal distribution \\(p_{i,j}(x_i,x_j) = p_i(x_i)p_j(x_j)\\). If all the variables are independent of each other, we can factor the whole joint distribution into products too,\n\\[p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} p_i(x_i) = p_0(x_0)p_1(x_1) \\cdots p_{n-1}(x_{n-1}).\\]\nNotation: Trying to keep track of all these notations, where each distribution has its own indices, containing variables with the same indices can be a mess. For this reason it’s common in practice to omit the subscripts when writing down distributions. So instead of writing \\(p_i(x_i)\\) we’d just write \\(p(x_i)\\), where it’s understood by the presence of \\(x_i\\) that we’re referring to the distribution \\(p_i(x_i)\\). This usually works fine, but it can be confusing in some cases, for example when multiple random variables come from the same distribution. We’ll see this exception below. Outside of those exceptions, assume that each distribution need not be the same.\nWhen dealing with \\(n\\) random variables, the most important cases to know about are: - When all variables individually come from the same marginal distribution \\(p(x)\\), i.e. \\(p(x)=p_1(x_1)=\\cdots=p_{n-1}(x_{n-1})\\). We then say the random variables are identically distributed, or ID for short. We’d write \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1} \\sim p(x)\\), to make it clear everything is sampled from the same distribution. - When all variables are independent of each other, in which case \\(p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}) = p_0(x_0)p_1(x_1) \\cdots p_{n-1}(x_{n-1})\\). A shorthand used sometimes to say random variables are all independent is to write \\(x_0 \\perp x_1 \\perp \\cdots \\perp x_{n-1}\\), where the symbol \\(\\perp\\) means “is independent of”. - When all variables are both identically distributed and independent. Lacking any creativity, we call such variables independent, identically distributed, or IID for short. As a short hand, if we sample \\(n\\) variables IID from some distribution \\(p(x)\\), we’d write\n\\[x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1} \\overset{iid}{\\sim} p(x), \\quad \\text{or just} \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\overset{iid}{\\sim} p(x).\\]\nIID functions have the nice property that their joint distribution factors into a product of marginals that all follow the same distribution,\n\\[p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} p(x_i) = p(x_0) p(x_1) \\cdots p(x_{n-1}),\\]\nwhere it’s understood each \\(p(x_i)\\) on the right is the same marginal distribution, so \\(p(x)=p_0(x)=\\cdots=p_{n-1}(x)\\). This property is really nice because it means all we need to do to find the joint distribution is to find a single marginal distribution. By studying one, we’re studying them all.\nWe can also condition any random variable on one or more other random variables. For example, if we condition \\(x_{n-1}\\) on \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2}\\), then its conditional distribution is given by\n\\[p(x_{n-1}|x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2}) = \\frac{p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2},x_{n-1})}{p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2})}.\\]\nThis conditional probability is equivalent to asking, how much information is contained in the joint distribution \\(p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2},x_{n-1})\\) if we already knew the marginal distribution \\(p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2})\\). Equivalently, how much information do the random variables \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-2}\\) give us about the variable \\(x_{n-1}\\).\nWe can derive the general form of Bayes Rule in a similar way to the bivariate case. For example, if we know what \\(p(x_0|x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1})\\), \\(p(x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1})\\), and \\(p(x_0)\\) are, then we can get \\(p(x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}|x_0)\\) by taking\n\\[p(x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}|x_0) = \\frac{p(x_0|x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}) p(x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1})}{p(x_0)}.\\]\nI realize this section looks confusing. If you take nothing else away from this section, take away the idea of what IID random variables are. Almost all of machine learning in some way depends on the assumption that data is IID in some way or another. We’ll see enough examples as we go that you should start getting somewhat comfortable with joint distributions of \\(n\\) variables. Most of the time they’ll be IID."

    "text": "Application: The Central Limit Theorem\nAn interesting application of the use of joint random variables is in considering the sum of \\(n\\) IID Bernoulli random variables. Suppose we sample \\(n\\) times IID from a Bernoulli distribution,\n\\[x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1} \\overset{iid}{\\sim} \\text{Ber}(\\text{p}).\\]\nConsider a new random variable \\(x\\) gotten by summing up all these IID Bernoulli variables,\n\\[x = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x_j = x_0 + x_1 + \\cdots x_{n-1}.\\]\nLet’s stare at this expression and see what we can already deduce about the sum \\(x\\). Since each \\(x_i=0,1\\), the smallest \\(x\\) can ever be is \\(0\\) (when all \\(x_i=0\\)), and the largest it can be is \\(n\\) (when all \\(x_i=1\\)), so \\(x\\) must have support \\(0,1,2,\\cdots,n\\). Next, let’s use the fact that all the \\(x_i\\) are IID and see what that gives us. In this case, the joint distribution is\n\\[p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}) = p(x_0)p(x_1) \\cdots p(x_{n-1}).\\]\nSince each \\(x_i \\sim \\text{Ber}(\\text{p})\\), we must then have\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\np(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}) &= p(x_0)p(x_1) \\cdots p(x_{n-1}) \\\\\n&= \\text{p}^{x_0}(1-\\text{p})^{1-x_0} \\text{p}^{x_1}(1-\\text{p})^{1-x_1} \\cdots \\text{p}^{x_{n-1}}(1-\\text{p})^{1-x_{n-1}} \\\\\n&= \\text{p}^{x_0+x_1+\\cdots+x_{n-1}} (1-\\text{p})^{n-(x_0+x_1+\\cdots+x_{n-1})} \\\\\n&= \\text{p}^{x} (1-\\text{p})^{n-x}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nYou may recall that this expression looks kind of like the expression for the binomial distribution,\n\\[p(x; n,\\text{p}) = \\binom{n}{x} \\text{p}^{x} (1-\\text{p})^{n-x}, \\quad \\text{where } x=0,1,\\cdots,n.\\]\nEvidently, the joint distribution \\(p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1})\\) pretty much is the binomial distribution \\(p(x; n,\\text{p})\\). If we just re-normalize each term by summing over all \\(x=1,2,\\cdots,n\\) and setting the sum equal to one, we get the same normalizing constants from the binomial distribution, namely the binomial coefficients\n\\[\\binom{n}{x} = \\frac{n!}{n!(n-x)!}.\\]\nWe’ve thus shown that the binomial distribution is just the sum of \\(n\\) IID Bernoulli random variables. IID Bernoulli random variables are often called Bernoulli trials. You can think of Bernoulli trials as being equivalent to flipping a (not necessarily fair) coin \\(n\\) times and asking which ones turn up heads. The total number of heads from \\(n\\) coin flips would be given by a binomial distribution \\(\\text{Bin}(n,\\text{p})\\).\nA curious fact is that the binomial distribution looks like a Gaussian distribution when \\(n\\) is large and \\(\\text{p}\\) isn’t too close to 0 or 1. Then,\n\\[\\text{Bin}(n,\\text{p}) \\approx \\mathcal{N}(n\\text{p}, n\\text{p}(1-\\text{p})).\\]\nThat is, the binomial distribution in such cases has an approximate bell-curved shape that’s centered around a mean of \\(n\\text{p}\\) with a variance of \\(n\\text{p}(1-\\text{p})\\).\nThis is a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem. The CLT, which I won’t prove, says that if we have \\(n\\) IID random variables all with the same mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then, provided \\(n\\) is large, the distribution of their sum will be approximately a Gaussian,\n\\[x = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\bigg(n\\mu, n\\sigma^2\\bigg).\\]\nIn the case of Bernoulli trials, each \\(x_i\\) has mean \\(\\mu=\\text{p}\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=\\text{p}(1-\\text{p})\\), so \\(x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(n\\text{p}, n\\text{p}(1-\\text{p}))\\). It’s kind of weird when you think about it. The CLT is saying no matter what distribution we sample from, as long as we sample IID a whole bunch of times, then the sum of those samples will be roughly Gaussian. In fact, the samples need not even be IID, but I won’t go into that.\nI’ll show a quick example of this fact below by sampling from a binomial distribution 10,000 times with parameters \\(n=1000\\) and \\(\\text{p}=0.5\\). Notice first how bell-shaped the histogram appears, similar to a Gaussian. Also notice how almost all of the values seem to lie in the range \\(500 \\pm 32\\), as you’d expect for a Gaussian distribution with mean \\(500\\) and variance \\(250\\).\nEvidently, if you flip a fair coin 10,000 times, the total number of heads would be roughly Gaussian distributed just like this example. Curious, right?\n\nn = 1000\np = 0.5\nx = np.random.binomial(n, p, size=10000)\nplot_histogram(x, title=f'$Bin({n},{p}) \\\\approx \\mathcal{{N}}({int(n*p)}, {int(n*p*(1-p))})$', is_discrete=True)"

    "text": "Continuous Multivariate Distributions\nAll of the common distributions we’ve covered so far can be extended into the multivariate case. The most useful multivariate extensions for machine learning purposes is the multivariate Gaussian distribution.\nProduct Distributions: \\(p(x_0,x_1,\\cdots) = p_1(x_0)p_1(x_1)\\cdots\\)\nMultivariate Gaussian Distribution: \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})\\)\nThe multivariate Gaussian distribution, denoted by the symbol \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})\\), is defined on all of \\(n\\) dimensional space \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) with density function\n\\[p(\\mathbf{x}) = (2 \\pi)^{-n/2} |\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|^{-1/2} \\exp\\bigg(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^\\top  \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})\\bigg),\\]\nwhere \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is an n-dimensional real vector and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}\\) is a positive square matrix. The vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is the \\(n\\) dimensional generalization of the mean, which is just a vector of means. The mean of variable \\(x_i\\) is \\(\\mu_i\\) for all \\(i=0,\\cdots,n-1\\). The matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) is called the covariance matrix. It’s a symmetric, positive matrix that generalizes the notion of variance to \\(n\\) dimensions. Why a matrix? Because each \\(x_i,x_j\\) can have a notion of (co)variance with each other. More on this soon.\nNotice the special symbol \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|\\) in the constant term outside the exponential. It’s not important to know what this is. Just consider it a function of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) alone. If you must know, it’s the determinant of the matrix. The only thing worth knowing is when \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) is diagonal, \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|\\) is the product of the diagonal elements, which I’ll use below.\nNote the exponent term is really just a sum of a bunch of scalar terms when expanded out, \\[(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu})^\\top  \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (x_i - \\mu_i) \\cdot \\Sigma_{i,j}^{-1} \\cdot (x_j - \\mu_j),\\] hence the exponent is really just the sum of a bunch of quadratic terms, reminiscent of the univariate Gaussian.\nIn the special case when the covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) is diagonal, we say the random variables \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}\\) are uncorrelated. Suppose \\[\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\text{diag}(\\sigma_0^2, \\sigma_2^2, \\cdots, \\sigma_{n-1}^2).\\] You can pretty easily verify that its inverse is simply the reciprocals of the diagonal terms, \\[\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} = \\text{diag}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_0^2}, \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2}, \\cdots, \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{n-1}^2}\\bigg).\\] This makes the complicated looking exponent term reduce to a simple sum of squares. Using the fact \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}|=\\sigma_0\\sigma_1\\cdots\\sigma_{n-1}\\) as well, we get\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\np(\\mathbf{x}) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma_0 \\sigma_1 \\cdots \\sigma_{n-1}}} \\exp\\bigg(-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu_i)^2}{\\sigma_i^2} \\bigg) \\\\\n&= \\Bigg(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma_0^2}} \\exp{\\bigg(-\\frac{(x_0 - \\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma_0^2}\\bigg)} \\Bigg) \\cdots \\Bigg(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma_{n-1}^2}} \\exp{\\bigg(-\\frac{(x_{n-1} - \\mu_{n-1})^2}{2\\sigma_{n-1}^2}\\bigg)} \\Bigg) \\\\\n&= p(x_0) p(x_1) \\cdots p(x_{n-1}).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThat is, the joint distribution \\(p(\\mathbf{x})\\) factors into a product of marginal Gaussian distributions \\(p(x_0) p(x_1) \\cdots p(x_{n-1})\\). This means that the variables \\(x_0,x_1,\\cdots,x_{n-1}\\) must be independent if they’re uncorrelated. In the further special case where \\(\\mu_i=\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma_i^2=\\sigma^2\\) for all \\(i\\), they’re also IID.\nThis distribution is so important to machine learning that it’s worth taking some time to visualize it, as a surface in 3D space, as a set of contours, as 3D histogram, and as a heat map. Let’s start with the first two. Suppose our random variable \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x,y)\\) is 2D. I’m going to plot the surface of the density function \\(p(x,y)\\) as well as the contour plot side-by-side using a helper function plot_multivariate_normal. This function will take in the mean vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\) and plot what the distribution looks like for that pair of parameters.\nLet’s define \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=(\\mu_x, \\mu_y)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_x^2 & \\sigma_{x,y} \\\\ \\sigma_{x,y} & \\sigma_y^2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\) A few things to notice: - Changing \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) just changes where the density is centered. It doesn’t change the shape. - Changing \\(\\sigma_x^2\\) or \\(\\sigma_y^2\\) changes how much the density spreads in that direction. If they’re equal the density will be perfectly circular. If one is greater than the other the density will become elliptical. In the limit one becomes much much greater than the other, the density will essentially just become a univariate Gaussian. - Making \\(\\sigma_{x,y}\\) non-zero makes the density change its angle in the xy-plane. That’s what introducing correlation essentially does geometrically. - Making \\(\\sigma_{x,y}=0\\) means that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) become independent as I showed above. Geometrically, independence essentially rotates until the density is aligned along the axes themselves.\nFeel free to play around with different choices of parameters and see how it affects the densities.\n\nmu = np.array([0, 0])\nSigma = np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 2]])\nplot_multivariate_gaussian(mu, Sigma, elev=10, azim=45)\n\n\n\n\nWe can also of course plot the histograms. Suppose we sample a bunch of points \\((x,y) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})\\) a bunch of times and plot the histogram. We can do this in python by again using np.random.randn, but passing in a shape \\((m,n)\\) instead of a single number.\nWhen \\(n=2\\) we can plot the histogram in 3D space. I’ll plot the standard 2D Gaussian \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})\\), which has mean zero and identity covariance. It’s the multivariate generalization of the standard \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) Gaussian. I’m using another helper function called plot_3d_hist here to hide a lot of ugly code.\n\nX = np.random.randn(10000, 2)\nx, y = X[:, 0], X[:, 1]\nplot_3d_hist(x, y, bins=30, xlim=(-2, 2), ylim=(-2, 2), elev=20, azim=30, \n             title='3D Histogram: $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})$')\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can view the same histogram contour-style using what’s called a heat map. A heat map is a way of plotting one variable that depends on 2 others, e.g. \\(p(x,y)\\) vs \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). In each grid of the plot the color indicates how “hot” the dependent variable is. The higher the counts in a given bin, the hotter the heat map will look at that bin. We can plot a histogram-style heatmap in matplotlib using plt.hist2d. Heat maps are very useful ways of visualizing data like this, usually more so than janky 3D plots like the one above.\n\nplt.hist2d(x, y, bins=30)\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.title('Heat Map: $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})$')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n# add product distributions, multivariate laplace, one-hot categorical, multinomial"
