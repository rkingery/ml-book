    "## Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we've talked about numbers, tuples of numbers, and mappings between them. It's also sometimes useful to think about collections of things. These things may be numbers or they may not. In math these collections of things are called **sets**. Suppose for example we want to simultaneously talk about multiple numbers at once, say -1, 0, and 1. We can put them into a set $S=\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and talk about the set $S$ as representing all of these numbers at once. The only thing that must hold is elements in a set can't repeat, so for example we can't have -1 appearing twice. It's already there. No need to count it twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"things\" inside a set are called **elements** of the set. To say $x$ is an element of a set $S$ it's common to use the short-hand $x \\in S$. If $x$ is *not* in $S$ we'd similarly write $x \\notin S$. For example, if $S=\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, then $-1 \\in S$, but $2 \\notin S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can contain more than numbers. We can have a set with nothing at all in it, $S=\\{\\}$. This is called the **empty set**, and is usually written as $\\emptyset$. We can have a set with other sets inside it, like\n",
    "$$S = \\{1, 2, \\{3, 4\\}\\}.$$\n",
    "We can even do weird things like create new sets from nested empty sets, for example\n",
    "$$S = \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}, \\{\\emptyset, \\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like numbers have arithmetic operations defined on them, sets have arithmetic-like operations defined on them as well.\n",
    "- The set analogue to addition is called **union**. The union of two sets $S$ and $T$ is just the set that combines their two (unique) elements into one new set. It's usually denoted $S \\cup T$. For example,\n",
    "$$\\{-1, 0, 1\\} \\cup \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{-1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}.$$\n",
    "- The set analogue to multiplication is called **intersection**. The intersection of two sets $S$ and $T$ is the set that contains only the elements in *both* sets. It's usually denoted $S \\cap T$. For example, \n",
    "$$\\{-1, 0, 1\\} \\cap \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{1\\}.$$\n",
    "If the two sets don't contain any common elements then their intersection is empty, $S \\cap T = \\emptyset$. When the intersection of two sets is empty we say they are **disjoint** sets.\n",
    "- If a set $S$ only contains some elements of a larger set $T$, we say $S$ is a **subset** of $T$. This is denoted $S \\subset T$. For example, \n",
    "$$\\{0, 1\\} \\subset \\{-1, 0, 1\\}.$$\n",
    "By convention, a set is allowed to be a subset of itself, $T \\subset T$. The empty set is also always a subset, $\\emptyset \\subset T$. We also can say symmetrically that $T$ is a **superset** of $S$.\n",
    "- The set analogue to negation is called the **complement**. If $S \\subset T$, the complement of $S$ is all the elements in $T$ that are *not* in $S$. The complement is usually written $S^C$. For example,\n",
    "$$\\{0, 1\\} \\subset \\{-1, 0, 1\\} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\{0, 1\\}^C = \\{-1\\}.$$\n",
    "Note the complement only makes sense when a set is subset of a larger set. Without knowing what that larger set is, you can't say anything about the complement.\n",
    "- The set analogue of subtraction is the **set difference**. The set difference of $S$ from the set $T$ is all the elements in $S$ that are not in $T$. This is usually denoted $S \\setminus T$. For example,\n",
    "$$\\{-1, 0, 1, 2\\} \\setminus \\{1, 2\\} = \\{-1, 0\\}.$$\n",
    "- The set analogue of the absolute value is **cardinality**. The cardinality of a set $S$ is just the total number of elements it contains. It's usually denoted $|S|$. For example,\n",
    "$$\\big|\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\big| = 5.$$\n",
    "- Another operation we can do with sets that doesn't really have an arithmetic equivalent is the **Cartesian product**. If $S$ and $T$ are two sets, define their Cartesian product as the set of all ordered pairs (i.e. tuples) whose first elements are in $S$ and whose second elements are in $T$. This is usually denoted $S \\times T$. For example,\n",
    "$$\\{-1, 0\\} \\times \\{1, 2\\} = \\{(-1, 1), (-1, 2), (0, 1), (0, 2)\\}.$$\n",
    "If $S$ has cardinality $n$ and $T$ cardinality $n$, then $S \\times T$ has cardinality $|S| \\cdot |T| = n \\cdot m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many of these operations, just as with numbers, we can naturally apply them to more than two sets at a time. We can take the union, intersection, and Cartesian product of as many sets we like. The definitions extend as you'd expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we won't use it a huge amount, I'll briefly mention that python in fact has a data type called `set` that more or less mimics the above properties. Here's an example of how it works using the two sets $S = \\{-1, 0, 1, 2\\}$, $T = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "S = set([-1, 0, 1, 2])\n",
    "T = set([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    "S.union(T) # S union T\n",
    "S.intersection(T) # S intersect T\n",
    "S.difference(T) # S \\ T\n",
    "S.issubset(T) # is S < T\n",
    "S.issuperset(T) # is T > S\n",
    "len(S) # |S|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bigger Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like list comprehensions like `[x for x in range(1000) if x > 100]` are a useful way to build lists with large numbers of elements, sets have a similar notation for constructing sets out of larger elements. The equivalent set with the elements of the above list comprehension would be denoted as\n",
    "$$S = \\{x: x=0, 1, \\cdots, 999 \\text{ and }x > 100\\}.$$\n",
    "This notation is sometimes called \"set builder notation\", but the term isn't as important as the idea. Read these expression as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is an integer between 0 and 999 and $x > 100$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this notation to talk about sets with infinitely many items too, like the set of all integers or the set of all real numbers. These sets are so important they have special symbols using block-face letters,\n",
    "- The set of all natural numbers is denoted $\\mathbb{N} = \\{x : x=0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots\\}$.\n",
    "- The set of all integers is denoted $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{x : x=\\cdots, -1, 0, 1, \\cdots\\}$.\n",
    "- The set of all rational numbers is denoted $\\mathbb{Q} = \\big\\{x : x=\\frac{a}{b} \\text{ where } a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ with } b \\neq 0 \\big\\}$.\n",
    "- The set of all real numbers is denoted $\\mathbb{R} = \\{x : x \\text{ is real}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Cartesian product we can \"square\" these sets to get pairs or triplets of numbers. For example, the set $\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all pairs of real numbers. That is, the set of all coordinates in the xy-plane. The set $\\mathbb{R}^3 = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all triplets of real numbers, i.e. the set of all coordinates in xyz-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final type of sets I'll mention are the **intervals**. These are contiguous subsets of the real numbers. If you think of the real numbers as the number line, intervals are the line segments connecting any two given points. If $a < b$ are two real numbers, we can define a few different intervals between them depending which endpoints we want to include,\n",
    "- Open interval: $(a, b) = \\{x: a < x < b \\}$.\n",
    "- Half-open left interval: $(a, b] = \\{x: a < x \\leq b \\}$.\n",
    "- Half-open right interval: $[a, b) = \\{x: a \\leq x < b \\}$.\n",
    "- Closed interval: $[a, b] = \\{x: a \\leq x \\leq b \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions Between Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define functions abstractly using sets as well. A function is a unique mapping between two sets. If $A$ and $B$ are two sets, then $f:A \\rightarrow B$ is a function that maps elements of $A$ to elements of $B$. We can also write $f(a)=b$ when the two sets are understood. In this context we say $A$ is the **domain** of the function $f$, and $B$ is the **codomain** of $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note this abstract definition of a function says nothing about the *functional form* of $f$. We still have to define that explicitly by specifying a rule that maps inputs to outputs, e.g. $f(a)=a^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The univariate functions $y=f(x)$ we defined above map real numbers to real numbers, so we could write them $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. The bivariate functions $z=f(x,y)$ we saw could be written $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $f$ maps every element of $A$ to a *unique* element of $B$ we say $f$ is a **one-to-one** function. One-to-one functions have the useful property that they can be inverted. We can uniquely build a new **inverse** function $f^{-1}$ by reversing the direction of the map, $f^{-1}:B \\rightarrow A$. If $f(a)=b$, then $f^{-1}(b)=a$. Note that not every element of $B$ may be a valid input to the inverse function due to the following situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It need not always be true that every element of $A$ map to every element of $B$. It could very well be the case for some $b \\in B$ that $f(a) \\neq b$ for any $a \\in A$. When we *can* always find an $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, we say the function $f$ is an **onto** function. Otherwise the set of mappings $f(a)=b$ is a *subset* of $B$, called the **range** of $f$. The range of $f:A \\rightarrow B$ is sometimes denoted $f(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $f$ is both one-to-one and onto it's said to be a **bijection**. When $f$ is a bijection, not only can we define an inverse mapping $f^{-1}$, but we can define it on all values of $B$. Otherwise we can only define the inverse on $f(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, except perhaps in pure academic research, understanding sets and their notation is pretty much only important when defining what range of values variables are defined on. For example, saying $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for \"let $x$ be a real number\". For that reason, don't feel the need to go too deep into this stuff unless you're the pure research type."

    "\n",
    "Since in machine learning we typically find ourselves performing operations on large numbers of numbers at a time. By far the most common operation is adding up a bunch of numbers, or **summation**. Suppose we have some **sequence** of $n$ numbers $x_0,x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_{n-1}$. They could be anything, related by a function, or not. If we wanted to sum them together to get a new number $x$ we could write\n",
