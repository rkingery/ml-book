    "For the purposes of machine learning, by far the most important application of differentiation and calculus in general is to optimization. **Optimization** is the problem of finding the \"best\" values with respect to some function. Usually in machine learning, by \"best\" we mean finding the minimum value of a *loss function*, which is a function that measures agreement between a model's prediction and the data it sees. Finding the minimum value of the loss function essentially means we've found the best weights for our model, the ones that give the highest accuracy on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting fact is that for a reasonably smooth function, its minimum value will *always* be at a point where the derivative is zero. To see why, consider our tangent line plot of $y=x^2$ from before. What happens if we set our point of interest to be $x_0=0$? Clearly that's the minimum of this function. At this point, the tangent line hugs the parabola horizontally, which means it's a point where the slope is zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "This same fact also holds for the maximum of a function as well. Not just the maximum, but any other point where the function is flat, called **saddle points**. As an example, the origin is a saddle-point of the function $y=x^3$. These general points where the derivative is zero (min, max, or saddle point) are called **stationary points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning we usually care most about the minimum. I'll just mention that we can formulate any maximum problem as a minimum problem by just multiplying the function by -1, which flips the function upside down, turning any maxima into minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose we have a univariate function $y=f(x)$. The problem of (unconstrained) optimization is to find a point $x^*$ such that $y^* = f(x^*)$ is the **minimum** value of $f(x)$, i.e. \n",
    "$$y^* = \\min f(x) \\leq f(x) \\text{ for all } x.$$\n",
    "The special point $x^*$ that minimizes the function is called the **argmin**, written $$x^* = \\text{argmin } f(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to mention a subtle point. What do I mean when I say \"the minimum\"? When I say $y^* \\leq f(x)$ for all $x$, which $x$ values am I talking about? This means we're really only talking about the minimum over some *range* of $x$ values. We have to specify what that range is. If the range is the whole real line, it really is *the* minimum, usually called the **global minimum**. If it's over some subset of the real line it may not be the global minimum since we're not looking at every $x$. It's only the minimum in our region of interest. This sort of region-specific minimum is called a **local minimum**. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this seems like a subtle point, it is an important one in machine learning. Some algorithms, like deep learning algorithms, can only reliably find a local minimum. Finding the global minimum can be harder unless there's only one minimum to begin with. These simple functions are called **convex functions**. Our above example of $y=x^2$ is a convex function. It only has one minimum, and the function just slopes up around it on both sides in a bowl shape. Deep learning loss functions on the other hand are nasty, wiggly things with lots of bumps and valleys. Such functions are called **non-convex functions**. In general they'll have lots of local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "So back to the fact about the derivative being zero at the minimum, what we \"proved\" by example is that at the point $x^*$ we should have\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x^*)=0.$$\n",
    "Another useful way to state the same fact is to think in terms of infinitesimals: At $x^*$, any infinitesimal perturbation $dx$ won't change the value of the function at all, $f(x^*+dx) = f(x^*)$. This is just another way of stating that $dy=0$ at $x^*$. The fact that small perturbations don't change the function's value is unique to minima and other stationary points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's verify this fact with the same example $y=x^2$ by looking at small perturbations around $x=0$. Since $f(0)=0$ is a minimum, any perturbation should just give $0$ as well. Choosing a $dx$ of `1e-5`, we can see that the function's perturbed value $f(0+dx)$ is only about `1e-10`, essentially negligible since $dx^2 \\approx 0$ for infinitesimals. This won't be true for any other value of $x$, e.g. $x=1$, which has a much larger change of `2e-5`, which is on the order of $dx$, as expected.\n",

    "Pretty much everything I've said on optimization extends naturally to higher dimensions. That's why I went into so much detail on the simple univariate case. It's easier to explain and visualize. To extend to $n$ dimensions we basically just need to convert inputs into vectors and derivatives into gradients. Other than this the formulas all look basically the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have now a scalar-valued multivariate function $z=f(\\mathbf{x})=f(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)$. The problem of (unconstrained) optimization is to find a vector $\\mathbf{x}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $z^* = f(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ is the **minimum** value of $f(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e. \n",

    "$$\\frac{d}{d\\mathbf{x}}f(\\mathbf{x^*})=\\mathbf{0}.$$\n",
    "Another way of stating the same fact is that at the minimum $f(\\mathbf{x^*} + d\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x^*})$ for any  infinitesimal perturbation vector $d\\mathbf{x}$. Equivalently, $dz=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the minimum is so important how do we actually find the thing? For simple functions like $y=x^2$ we can do it just by plotting the function, or by trial and error. We can also do it analytically by solving the equation $\\frac{dy}{dx}\\big|_{x^*}=0$ for $x^*$. But for complicated functions, or functions we can't exactly write down, this isn't feasible. We need an algorithmic way to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try something simple. Since the derivative at $x$ tells us the slope of the function at $x$, it's in some sense telling us how far we are away from the minimum. Suppose we perturb $x$ to $dx$. Then $y=f(x)$ gets perturbed to $y+dy=f(x+dx)$. Now, observe the almost trivial fact that\n",
    "$$dy = \\frac{dy}{dx}dx.$$\n",
    "So if $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is *large*, small changes in $x$ will result in large changes in $y$. Similarly, if $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is *small*, then small changes in $x$ will result in small changes in $y$. But we demonstrated above that if we're near the minimum we *know* that changes in $y$ will be tiny if $dx$ is small. Thus, the derivative serves as a kind of \"how close are we to the minimum\" metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not all the derivative tells us. Since the sign of the derivative indicates which way the slope is slanting, it also tells us which direction the minimum is in. If you're at a point on the function, the minimum will always be in the direction that's sloping downward from you. Since the slope slants upward in the direction of the sign of the derivative, and we want to move downward the other way, **the minimum will be in the direction of the negative of the derivative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, suppose we want to find the minimum of $y=f(x)$. To start, we'll pick a point $x_0$ at random. Doesn't matter too much how. Pick a step size, we'll call it $\\alpha$. This will multiply the derivative and tell us how big of a step to take towards the minimum (more on why this is important in a second). Now, we'll take a step towards the minimum\n",
    "$$x_1 = x_0 - \\alpha \\frac{dy}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0}.$$\n",
    "This puts us at a new point $x_1$, which will be closer to the argmin $x^*$ if our step size is small enough. Now do it again,\n",
    "$$x_2 = x_1 - \\alpha \\frac{dy}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_1}.$$\n",
    "And again,\n",
    "$$x_3 = x_2 - \\alpha \\frac{dy}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_2}.$$\n",
    "Keep doing this over and over. Stop when the points aren't changing much anymore, i.e. when $|x_{n+1}-x_n|<\\varepsilon$ for some small tolerance $\\varepsilon$. Then we can say that the argmin is $x^* \\approx x_n$, and the minimum is $y^* \\approx f(x_n)$. Done.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple algorithm to find the (local) minimum by starting at a random point and steadily marching in the direction of the derivative is called **gradient descent**. With some relatively minor modifications here and there, gradient descent is how many machine learning algorithms are trained, including essentially all deep learning algorithms. It's very possibly the most important algorithm in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, running an optimizer like gradient descent is usually called **training**. You can kind of imagine optimization as trying to teach something to a model. The condition of being at the minimum is analogous to the model learning whatever task it is you're trying to teach it. The thing we're minimizing in this case is the loss function, which is hand-picked essentially to measure how well the model is learning the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step size $\\alpha$ is so important in machine learning that it's given a special name, the **learning rate**. It in essence controls how quickly a model learns, or trains. I'll use this terminology for $\\alpha$ going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the algorithm looks like as a python function `gradient_descent`. It will take as arguments the function `f` we're trying to minimize, the function for its derivative or gradient `grad_fn`, the initial point `x0`, the learning rate `alpha`. I'll also pass in two optional arguments, `max_iter` and `eps`, where `max_iter` is how many iterations to run gradient descent in the worst case, and `eps` is the tolerance parameter to indicate when to stop.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that gradient descent in this case converges (i.e. finishes) after only 27 iterations. It predicts an argmin of about $x^* \\approx 3 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ and a minimum of about $y^* \\approx 9 \\cdot 10^{12}$. Since both are basically $0$ (the true value for both) to within one part in $10^{-5}$ we seem to have done pretty well here. \n",

What I'm going to do is plot the function curve in black, and on top of it show each step of gradient descent. Each red dot on the curve of the function will indicate the point $(x_n,y_n)$ at step $n$ of the algorithm. Successive steps will be connected by a red line. Each red line will show which points the algorithm jumps from and to at each step. Starting and ending points will be annotated as well.\n",

    "I'll start by showing what gradient descent is doing on the exact same example as above. The curve of course is just a parabola sloping upward from the origin. The starting point is just $(x_0,f(x_0))=(5,25)$. After running for $N=30$ iterations the algorithm basically settles down to $(x_N,f(x_N)) \\approx (0,0)$. Notice what's happening in between though. Imagine you dropped a marble into a bowl at the starting point. After landing, the marble bounces across the bowl several times as it settles down around the origin, where it rolls around less and less until it eventually dissipates all its kinetic energy and settles down at the bottom of the bowl.\n",

Unfortunately, there are a few subtleties involved that I've yet to mention. It turns out that the function I picked, $y=x^2$ is a particularly easy function to minimize. It's a convex function. Not all functions behave that nicely. Practically no loss function in deep learning does.\n",

Some other algorithms worth noting use not just the first derivative in their updates, but also the second derivative. Examples include algorithms like Newton's Method and LBFGS. The second derivative provides information about the curvature of the function, which can speed up convergence by making the learning rate adaptive. While these *second-order* algorithms are useful in some areas of machine learning, it usually turns out to be far too computationally expensive to calculate the second derivative (also called the Hessian) of a function in high dimensions. Perhaps the main reason gradient descent is used in machine learning is because it provides a good tradeoff between its speed of convergence and computational performance.\n",
